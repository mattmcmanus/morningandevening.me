<p>Israel's weary wanderings were all over, and the promised rest was ttained. No more moving tents, fiery serpents, fierce Amalekites, and owling wildernesses: they came to the land which flowed with milk and oney, and they ate the old corn of the land. Perhaps this year, eloved Christian reader, this may be thy case or mine. Joyful is the rospect, and if faith be in active exercise, it will yield unalloyed elight. To be with Jesus in the rest which remaineth for the people of od, is a cheering hope indeed, and to expect this glory so soon is a ouble bliss. Unbelief shudders at the Jordan which still rolls between s and the goodly land, but let us rest assured that we have already xperienced more ills than death at its worst can cause us. Let us anish every fearful thought, and rejoice with exceeding great joy, in he prospect that this year we shall begin to be "forever with the ord."</p>
<p>A part of the host will this year tarry on earth, to do service for heir Lord. If this should fall to our lot, there is no reason why the ew Year's text should not still be true. "We who have believed do nter into rest." The Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance; he ives us "glory begun below." In heaven they are secure, and so are we reserved in Christ Jesus; there they triumph over their enemies, and e have victories too. Celestial spirits enjoy communion with their ord, and this is not denied to us; they rest in his love, and we have erfect peace in him: they hymn his praise, and it is our privilege to less him too. We will this year gather celestial fruits on earthly round, where faith and hope have made the desert like the garden of he Lord. Man did eat angels' food of old, and why not now? O for grace o feed on Jesus, and so to eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan this ear!</p>

<p>Continue in prayer.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Colossians</span> <span class="chapter">4</span>:<span class="verse">2</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>It is interesting to remark how large a portion of Sacred Writ is ccupied with the subject of prayer, either in furnishing examples, nforcing precepts, or pronouncing promises. We scarcely open the Bible efore we read, "Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord;" and ust as we are about to close the volume, the "Amen" of an earnest upplication meets our ear. Instances are plentiful. Here we find a restling Jacob--there a Daniel who prayed three times a day--and a avid who with all his heart called upon his God. On the mountain we ee Elias; in the dungeon Paul and Silas. We have multitudes of ommands, and myriads of promises. What does this teach us, but the acred importance and necessity of prayer? We may be certain that hatever God has made prominent in his Word, he intended to be onspicuous in our lives. If he has said much about prayer, it is ecause he knows we have much need of it. So deep are our necessities, hat until we are in heaven we must not cease to pray. Dost thou want othing? Then, I fear thou dost not know thy poverty. Hast thou no ercy to ask of God? Then, may the Lord's mercy show thee thy misery! A rayerless soul is a Christless soul. Prayer is the lisping of the elieving infant, the shout of the fighting believer, the requiem of he dying saint falling asleep in Jesus. It is the breath, the atchword, the comfort, the strength, the honour of a Christian. If hou be a child of God, thou wilt seek thy Father's face, and live in hy Father's love. Pray that this year thou mayst be holy, humble, ealous, and patient; have closer communion with Christ, and enter ftener into the banqueting-house of his love. Pray that thou mayst be n example and a blessing unto others, and that thou mayst live more to he glory of thy Master. The motto for this year must be, "Continue in rayer."</p>

<div class="response">
<p>All things on earth need to be renewed. No created thing continueth by tself. "Thou renewest the face of the year," was the Psalmist's tterance. Even the trees, which wear not themselves with care, nor horten their lives with labour, must drink of the rain of heaven and uck from the hidden treasures of the soil. The cedars of Lebanon, hich God has planted, only live because day by day they are full of ap fresh drawn from the earth. Neither can man's life be sustained ithout renewal from God. As it is necessary to repair the waste of the ody by the frequent meal, so we must repair the waste of the soul by eeding upon the Book of God, or by listening to the preached Word, or y the soul-fattening table of the ordinances. How depressed are our races when means are neglected! What poor starvelings some saints are ho live without the diligent use of the Word of God and secret prayer! f our piety can live without God it is not of divine creating; it is ut a dream; for if God had begotten it, it would wait upon him as the lowers wait upon the dew. Without constant restoration we are not eady for the perpetual assaults of hell, or the stern afflictions of eaven, or even for the strifes within. When the whirlwind shall be oosed, woe to the tree that hath not sucked up fresh sap, and grasped he rock with many intertwisted roots. When tempests arise, woe to the ariners that have not strengthened their mast, nor cast their anchor, or sought the haven. If we suffer the good to grow weaker, the evil ill surely gather strength and struggle desperately for the mastery ver us; and so, perhaps, a painful desolation, and a lamentable isgrace may follow. Let us draw near to the footstool of divine mercy n humble entreaty, and we shall realize the fulfilment of the promise, "They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength."</p>

<p>"Grow in grace"--not in one grace only, but in all grace. Grow in that oot-grace, faith. Believe the promises more firmly than you have done. et faith increase in fulness, constancy, simplicity. Grow also in ove. Ask that your love may become extended, more intense, more ractical, influencing every thought, word, and deed. Grow likewise in umility. Seek to lie very low, and know more of your own nothingness. s you grow downward in humility, seek also to grow upward--having earer approaches to God in prayer and more intimate fellowship with esus. May God the Holy Spirit enable you to "grow in the knowledge of ur Lord and Saviour." He who grows not in the knowledge of Jesus, efuses to be blessed. To know him is "life eternal," and to advance in he knowledge of him is to increase in happiness. He who does not long o know more of Christ, knows nothing of him yet. Whoever hath sipped his wine will thirst for more, for although Christ doth satisfy, yet t is such a satisfaction, that the appetite is not cloyed, but hetted. If you know the love of Jesus--as the hart panteth for the ater-brooks, so will you pant after deeper draughts of his love. If ou do not desire to know him better, then you love him not, for love lways cries, "Nearer, nearer." Absence from Christ is hell; but the resence of Jesus is heaven. Rest not then content without an ncreasing acquaintance with Jesus. Seek to know more of him in his ivine nature, in his human relationship, in his finished work, in his eath, in his resurrection, in his present glorious intercession, and n his future royal advent. Abide hard by the Cross, and search the ystery of his wounds. An increase of love to Jesus, and a more perfect pprehension of his love to us is one of the best tests of growth in race.</p>

<p>And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>This morning our desires went forth for growth in our acquaintance with he Lord Jesus; it may be well tonight to consider a kindred topic, amely, our heavenly Joseph's knowledge of us. This was most blessedly erfect long before we had the slightest knowledge of him. "His eyes eheld our substance, yet being imperfect, and in his book all our embers were written, when as yet there was none of them." Before we ad a being in the world we had a being in his heart. When we were nemies to him, he knew us, our misery, our madness, and our ickedness. When we wept bitterly in despairing repentance, and viewed im only as a judge and a ruler, he viewed us as his brethren well eloved, and his bowels yearned towards us. He never mistook his hosen, but always beheld them as objects of his infinite affection. "The Lord knoweth them that are his," is as true of the prodigals who re feeding swine as of the children who sit at the table.</p>
<p>But, alas! we knew not our royal Brother, and out of this ignorance rew a host of sins. We withheld our hearts from him, and allowed him o entrance to our love. We mistrusted him, and gave no credit to his ords. We rebelled against him, and paid him no loving homage. The Sun f Righteousness shone forth, and we could not see him. Heaven came own to earth, and earth perceived it not. Let God be praised, those ays are over with us; yet even now it is but little that we know of esus compared with what he knows of us. We have but begun to study im, but he knoweth us altogether. It is a blessed circumstance that he ignorance is not on his side, for then it would be a hopeless case or us. He will not say to us, "I never knew you," but he will confess ur names in the day of his appearing, and meanwhile will manifest imself to us as he doth not unto the world.</p>

<p>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light rom the darkness.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Genesis</span> <span class="chapter">1</span>:<span class="verse">4</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Light might well be good since it sprang from that fiat of goodness, "Let there be light." We who enjoy it should be more grateful for it han we are, and see more of God in it and by it. Light physical is aid by Solomon to be sweet, but gospel light is infinitely more recious, for it reveals eternal things, and ministers to our immortal atures. When the Holy Spirit gives us spiritual light, and opens our yes to behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, we behold in in its true colours, and ourselves in our real position; we see the ost Holy God as he reveals himself, the plan of mercy as he propounds t, and the world to come as the Word describes it. Spiritual light has any beams and prismatic colours, but whether they be knowledge, joy, oliness, or life, all are divinely good. If the light received be thus ood, what must the essential light be, and how glorious must be the lace where he reveals himself. O Lord, since light is so good, give us ore of it, and more of thyself, the true light.</p>
<p>No sooner is there a good thing in the world, than a division is ecessary. Light and darkness have no communion; God has divided them, et us not confound them. Sons of light must not have fellowship with eeds, doctrines, or deceits of darkness. The children of the day must e sober, honest, and bold in their Lord's work, leaving the works of arkness to those who shall dwell in it forever. Our Churches should by iscipline divide the light from the darkness, and we should by our istinct separation from the world do the same. In judgment, in action, n hearing, in teaching, in association, we must discern between the recious and the vile, and maintain the great distinction which the ord made upon the world's first day. O Lord Jesus, be thou our light hroughout the whole of this day, for thy light is the light of men.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>This morning we noticed the goodness of the light, and the Lord's ividing it from the darkness, we now note the special eye which the ord had for the light. "God saw the light"--he looked at it with omplacency, gazed upon it with pleasure, saw that it "was good." If he Lord has given you light, dear reader, he looks on that light with eculiar interest; for not only is it dear to him as his own handiwork, ut because it is like himself, for "He is light." Pleasant it is to he believer to know that God's eye is thus tenderly observant of that ork of grace which he has begun. He never loses sight of the treasure hich he has placed in our earthen vessels. Sometimes we cannot see the ight, but God always sees the light, and that is much better than our eeing it. Better for the judge to see my innocence than for me to hink I see it. It is very comfortable for me to know that I am one of od's people--but whether I know it or not, if the Lord knows it, I am till safe. This is the foundation, "The Lord knoweth them that are is." You may be sighing and groaning because of inbred sin, and ourning over your darkness, yet the Lord sees "light" in your heart, or he has put it there, and all the cloudiness and gloom of your soul annot conceal your light from his gracious eye. You may have sunk low n despondency, and even despair; but if your soul has any longing owards Christ, and if you are seeking to rest in his finished work, od sees the "light." He not only sees it, but he also preserves it in ou. "I, the Lord, do keep it." This is a precious thought to those ho, after anxious watching and guarding of themselves, feel their own owerlessness to do so. The light thus preserved by his grace, he will ne day develop into the splendour of noonday, and the fulness of lory. The light within is the dawn of the eternal day.</p>

<p>The believer did not always live to Christ.

From the oment of the new and celestial birth the man begins to live to Christ. esus is to believers the one pearl of great price, for whom we are illing to part with all that we have. He has so completely won our ove, that it beats alone for him; to his glory we would live, and in efence of his gospel we would die; he is the pattern of our life, and he model after which we would sculpture our character. Paul's words ean more than most men think; they imply that the aim and end of his ife was Christ--nay, his life itself was Jesus. In the words of an ncient saint, he did eat, and drink, and sleep eternal life. Jesus was is very breath, the soul of his soul, the heart of his heart, the life f his life. Can you say, as a professing Christian, that you live up o this idea? Can you honestly say that for you to live is Christ? Your usiness--are you doing it for Christ? Is it not done for self- ggrandizement and for family advantage? Do you ask, "Is that a mean eason?" For the Christian it is. He professes to live for Christ; how an he live for another object without committing a spiritual adultery? any there are who carry out this principle in some measure; but who is here that dare say that he hath lived wholly for Christ as the apostle id? Yet, this alone is the true life of a Christian--its source, its ustenance, its fashion, its end, all gathered up in one word--Christ esus. Lord, accept me; I here present myself, praying to live only in hee and to thee.

Christ s near to thee in ties of relationship; Christ is dear to thee in onds of marriage union, and thou art dear to him; behold he grasps oth of thy hands with both his own, saying, "My sister, my spouse." Mark the two sacred holdfasts by which thy Lord gets such a double hold f thee that he neither can nor will ever let thee go. Be not, O eloved, slow to return the hallowed flame of his love.</p>

<p>The iniquity of the holy things.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Exodus</span> <span class="chapter">28</span>:<span class="verse">38</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>What a veil is lifted up by these words, and what a disclosure is made! t will be humbling and profitable for us to pause awhile and see this ad sight. The iniquities of our public worship, its hypocrisy, ormality, lukewarmness, irreverence, wandering of heart and orgetfulness of God, what a full measure have we there! Our work for he Lord, its emulation, selfishness, carelessness, slackness, nbelief, what a mass of defilement is there! Our private devotions, heir laxity, coldness, neglect, sleepiness, and vanity, what a ountain of dead earth is there! If we looked more carefully we should ind this iniquity to be far greater than appears at first sight. Dr. ayson, writing to his brother, says, "My parish, as well as my heart, ery much resembles the garden of the sluggard; and what is worse, I ind that very many of my desires for the melioration of both, proceed ither from pride or vanity or indolence. I look at the weeds which verspread my garden, and breathe out an earnest wish that they were radicated. But why? What prompts the wish? It may be that I may walk ut and say to myself, In what fine order is my garden kept!' This is ride. Or, it may be that my neighbours may look over the wall and say, ow finely your garden flourishes!' This is vanity. Or I may wish for he destruction of the weeds, because I am weary of pulling them up. his is indolence." So that even our desires after holiness may be olluted by ill motives. Under the greenest sods worms hide themselves; e need not look long to discover them. How cheering is the thought, hat when the High Priest bore the iniquity of the holy things he wore pon his brow the words, "Holiness to the Lord:" and even so while esus bears our sin, he presents before his Father's face not our nholiness, but his own holiness. O for grace to view our great High riest by the eye of faith!</p>

<p>Nothing gives the believer so much joy as fellowship with Christ. He as enjoyment as others have in the common mercies of life, he can be lad both in God's gifts and God's works; but in all these separately, ea, and in all of them added together, he doth not find such ubstantial delight as in the matchless person of his Lord Jesus. He as wine which no vineyard on earth ever yielded; he has bread which ll the corn-fields of Egypt could never bring forth. Where can such weetness be found as we have tasted in communion with our Beloved? In ur esteem, the joys of earth are little better than husks for swine ompared with Jesus, the heavenly manna. We would rather have one outhful of Christ's love, and a sip of his fellowship, than a whole orld full of carnal delights. What is the chaff to the wheat? What is he sparkling paste to the true diamond? What is a dream to the lorious reality? What is time's mirth, in its best trim, compared to ur Lord Jesus in his most despised estate? If you know anything of the nner life, you will confess that our highest, purest, and most nduring joys must be the fruit of the tree of life which is in the idst of the Paradise of God. No spring yields such sweet water as that ell of God which was digged with the soldier's spear. All earthly liss is of the earth earthy, but the comforts of Christ's presence are ike himself, heavenly. We can review our communion with Jesus, and ind no regrets of emptiness therein; there are no dregs in this wine, o dead flies in this ointment. The joy of the Lord is solid and nduring. Vanity hath not looked upon it, but discretion and prudence estify that it abideth the test of years, and is in time and in ternity worthy to be called "the only true delight." For nourishment, onsolation, exhilaration, and refreshment, no wine can rival the love f Jesus. Let us drink to the full this evening.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Delight in divine service is a token of acceptance. Those who serve God ith a sad countenance, because they do what is unpleasant to them, are ot serving him at all; they bring the form of homage, but the life is bsent. Our God requires no slaves to grace his throne; he is the Lord f the empire of love, and would have his servants dressed in the ivery of joy. The angels of God serve him with songs, not with groans;  murmur or a sigh would be a mutiny in their ranks. That obedience hich is not voluntary is disobedience, for the Lord looketh at the eart, and if he seeth that we serve him from force, and not because we ove him, he will reject our offering. Service coupled with heerfulness is heart-service, and therefore true. Take away joyful illingness from the Christian, and you have removed the test of his incerity. If a man be driven to battle, he is no patriot; but he who arches into the fray with flashing eye and beaming face, singing, "It s sweet for one's country to die," proves himself to be sincere in his atriotism. Cheerfulness is the support of our strength; in the joy of he Lord are we strong. It acts as the remover of difficulties. It is o our service what oil is to the wheels of a railway carriage. Without il the axle soon grows hot, and accidents occur; and if there be not a oly cheerfulness to oil our wheels, our spirits will be clogged with eariness. The man who is cheerful in his service of God, proves that bedience is his element; he can sing,</p>
<p>"Make me to walk in thy commands,</p>
 'Tis a delightful road."
<p>Reader, let us put this question--do you serve the Lord with gladness? et us show to the people of the world, who think our religion to be lavery, that it is to us a delight and a joy! Let our gladness roclaim that we serve a good Master.</p>

"But," said one, "are you not fraid lest you should miss your inheritance?" "Nay," said he, "nay; here is one crown in heaven which the angel Gabriel could not wear, it ill fit no head but mine. There is one throne in heaven which Paul the postle could not fill; it was made for me, and I shall have it." O hristian, what a joyous thought! thy portion is secure; "there emaineth a rest." "But cannot I forfeit it?" No, it is entailed. If I e a child of God I shall not lose it. It is mine as securely as if I ere there.

<div class="response">
<p>Mark the subject of Job's devout anticipation "I shall see God." He oes not say, "I shall see the saints"--though doubtless that will be ntold felicity--but, "I shall see God." It is not--"I shall see the early gates, I shall behold the walls of jasper, I shall gaze upon the rowns of gold," but "I shall see God." This is the sum and substance f heaven, this is the joyful hope of all believers. It is their elight to see him now in the ordinances by faith. They love to behold im in communion and in prayer; but there in heaven they shall have an pen and unclouded vision, and thus seeing "him as he is," shall be ade completely like him. Likeness to God--what can we wish for more? nd a sight of God--what can we desire better? Some read the passage, "Yet, I shall see God in my flesh," and find here an allusion to hrist, as the "Word made flesh," and that glorious beholding of him hich shall be the splendour of the latter days. Whether so or not it s certain that Christ shall be the object of our eternal vision; nor hall we ever want any joy beyond that of seeing him. Think not that his will be a narrow sphere for the mind to dwell in. It is but one ource of delight, but that source is infinite. All his attributes hall be subjects for contemplation, and as he is infinite under each spect, there is no fear of exhaustion. His works, his gifts, his love o us, and his glory in all his purposes, and in all his actions, these hall make a theme which will be ever new. The patriarch looked forward o this sight of God as a personal enjoyment. "Whom mine eye shall ehold, and not another." Take realizing views of heaven's bliss; think hat it will be to you. "Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty." All earthly brightness fades and darkens as we gaze upon it, but here s a brightness which can never dim, a glory which can never fade--"I hall see God."</p>

<p>My soul, examine thyself this morning by the light of this text. Thou ast received the word with joy; thy feelings have been stirred and a ively impression has been made; but, remember, that to receive the ord in the ear is one thing, and to receive Jesus into thy very soul s quite another; superficial feeling is often joined to inward ardness of heart, and a lively impression of the word is not always a asting one. In the parable, the seed in one case fell upon ground aving a rocky bottom, covered over with a thin layer of earth; when he seed began to take root, its downward growth was hindered by the ard stone and therefore it spent its strength in pushing its green hoot aloft as high as it could, but having no inward moisture derived rom root nourishment, it withered away. Is this my case? Have I been aking a fair show in the flesh without having a corresponding inner ife? Good growth takes place upwards and downwards at the same time. m I rooted in sincere fidelity and love to Jesus? If my heart remains nsoftened and unfertilized by grace, the good seed may germinate for a eason, but it must ultimately wither, for it cannot flourish on a ocky, unbroken, unsanctified heart. Let me dread a godliness as rapid n growth and as wanting in endurance as Jonah's gourd; let me count he cost of being a follower of Jesus, above all let me feel the energy f his Holy Spirit, and then I shall possess an abiding and enduring eed in my soul. If my mind remains as obdurate as it was by nature, he sun of trial will scorch, and my hard heart will help to cast the eat the more terribly upon the ill-covered seed, and my religion will oon die, and my despair will be terrible; therefore, O heavenly Sower, lough me first, and then cast the truth into me, and let me yield thee  bounteous harvest.</p>

Retirement may be lovely in its season, and to ide one's self is doubtless modest, but the hiding of Christ in us can ever be justified, and the keeping back of truth which is precious to urselves is a sin against others and an offence against God. If you re of a nervous temperament and of retiring disposition, take care hat you do not too much indulge this trembling propensity, lest you hould be useless to the church. Seek in the name of him who was not shamed of you to do some little violence to your feelings, and tell to thers what Christ has told to you.

Like ehoshaphat, we may be precious in the Lord's sight, although our chemes end in disappointment.</p>
<p>The secret cause of Jehoshaphat's loss is well worthy of notice, for it s the root of very much of the suffering of the Lord's people; it was is alliance with a sinful family, his fellowship with sinners. In 2 h. 20:37, we are told that the Lord sent a prophet to declare, "Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord hath broken hy works." This was a fatherly chastisement, which appears to have een blest to him; for in the verse which succeeds our morning's text e find him refusing to allow his servants to sail in the same vessels ith those of the wicked king. Would to God that Jehoshaphat's xperience might be a warning to the rest of the Lord's people, to void being unequally yoked together with unbelievers! A life of misery s usually the lot of those who are united in marriage, or in any other ay of their own choosing, with the men of the world. O for such love o Jesus that, like him, we may be holy, harmless, undefiled, and eparate from sinners; for if it be not so with us, we may expect to ear it often said, "The Lord hath broken thy works."</p>

<p>By the words "to save" we understand the whole of the great work of alvation, from the first holy desire onward to complete anctification. The words are multum in parro: indeed, here is all ercy in one word. Christ is not only "mighty to save" those who epent, but he is able to make men repent. He will carry those to eaven who believe; but he is, moreover, mighty to give men new hearts nd to work faith in them. He is mighty to make the man who hates oliness love it, and to constrain the despiser of his name to bend the nee before him. Nay, this is not all the meaning, for the divine power s equally seen in the after-work. The life of a believer is a series f miracles wrought by "the Mighty God." The bush burns, but is not onsumed. He is mighty to keep his people holy after he has made them o, and to preserve them in his fear and love until he consummates heir spiritual existence in heaven. Christ's might doth not lie in aking a believer and then leaving him to shift for himself; but he who egins the good work carries it on; he who imparts the first germ of ife in the dead soul, prolongs the divine existence, and strengthens t until it bursts asunder every bond of sin, and the soul leaps from arth, perfected in glory. Believer, here is encouragement. Art thou raying for some beloved one? Oh, give not up thy prayers, for Christ s "mighty to save." You are powerless to reclaim the rebel, but your ord is Almighty. Lay hold on that mighty arm, and rouse it to put orth its strength. Does your own case trouble you? Fear not, for his trength is sufficient for you. Whether to begin with others, or to arry on the work in you, Jesus is "mighty to save;" the best proof of hich lies in the fact that he has saved you. What a thousand mercies hat you have not found him mighty to destroy!</p>

The fox hies to its hole for protection; he bird flies to the wood for shelter; and even so the tried believer astens to the mercy seat for safety. Heaven's great harbour of refuge s All-prayer; thousands of weather-beaten vessels have found a haven here, and the moment a storm comes on, it is wise for us to make for t with all sail.</p>
<p>Short prayers are long enough. There were but three words in the etition which Peter gasped out, but they were sufficient for his urpose. Not length but strength is desirable. A sense of need is a ighty teacher of brevity. If our prayers had less of the tail feathers f pride and more wing they would be all the better. Verbiage is to evotion as chaff to the wheat. Precious things lie in small compass, nd all that is real prayer in many a long address might have been ttered in a petition as short as that of Peter.</p>
<p>Our extremities are the Lord's opportunities. Immediately a keen sense f danger forces an anxious cry from us the ear of Jesus hears, and ith him ear and heart go together, and the hand does not long linger. t the last moment we appeal to our Master, but his swift hand makes up or our delays by instant and effectual action. Are we nearly engulfed y the boisterous waters of affliction? Let us then lift up our souls nto our Saviour, and we may rest assured that he will not suffer us to erish. When we can do nothing Jesus can do all things; let us enlist is powerful aid upon our side, and all will be well.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>God's promises were never meant to be thrown aside as waste paper; he ntended that they should be used. God's gold is not miser's money, but s minted to be traded with. Nothing pleases our Lord better than to ee his promises put in circulation; he loves to see his children bring hem up to him, and say, "Lord, do as thou hast said." We glorify God hen we plead his promises. Do you think that God will be any the oorer for giving you the riches he has promised? Do you dream that he ill be any the less holy for giving holiness to you? Do you imagine he ill be any the less pure for washing you from your sins? He has said "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins e as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like rimson, they shall be as wool." Faith lays hold upon the promise of ardon, and it does not delay, saying, "This is a precious promise, I onder if it be true?" but it goes straight to the throne with it, and leads, "Lord, here is the promise, Do as thou hast said.'" Our Lord eplies, "Be it unto thee even as thou wilt." When a Christian grasps a romise, if he does not take it to God, he dishonours him; but when he astens to the throne of grace, and cries, "Lord, I have nothing to ecommend me but this, Thou hast said it;'" then his desire shall be ranted. Our heavenly Banker delights to cash his own notes. Never let he promise rust. Draw the sword of promise out of its scabbard, and se it with holy violence. Think not that God will be troubled by your mportunately reminding him of his promises. He loves to hear the loud utcries of needy souls. It is his delight to bestow favours. He is ore ready to hear than you are to ask. The sun is not weary of hining, nor the fountain of flowing. It is God's nature to keep his romises; therefore go at once to the throne with "Do as thou hast aid."</p>

<p>But I give myself unto prayer.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Psalm</span> <span class="chapter">109</span>:<span class="verse">4</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Lying tongues were busy against the reputation of David, but he did not efend himself; he moved the case into a higher court, and pleaded efore the great King himself. Prayer is the safest method of replying o words of hatred. The Psalmist prayed in no cold-hearted manner, he ave himself to the exercise--threw his whole soul and heart into t--straining every sinew and muscle, as Jacob did when wrestling with he angel. Thus, and thus only, shall any of us speed at the throne of race. As a shadow has no power because there is no substance in it, ven so that supplication, in which a man's proper self is not horoughly present in agonizing earnestness and vehement desire, is tterly ineffectual, for it lacks that which would give it force. "Fervent prayer," says an old divine, "like a cannon planted at the ates of heaven, makes them fly open." The common fault with the most f us is our readiness to yield to distractions. Our thoughts go roving ither and thither, and we make little progress towards our desired nd. Like quicksilver our mind will not hold together, but rolls off his way and that. How great an evil this is! It injures us, and what s worse, it insults our God. What should we think of a petitioner, if, hile having an audience with a prince, he should be playing with a eather or catching a fly?</p>
<p>Continuance and perseverance are intended in the expression of our ext. David did not cry once, and then relapse into silence; his holy lamour was continued till it brought down the blessing. Prayer must ot be our chance work, but our daily business, our habit and vocation. s artists give themselves to their models, and poets to their lassical pursuits, so must we addict ourselves to prayer. We must be mmersed in prayer as in our element, and so pray without ceasing. ord, teach us so to pray that we may be more and more prevalent in upplication.</p>

But lo, one sins nd another suffers. Justice was offended by us, but found its atisfaction in him. Rivers of tears, mountains of offerings, seas of he blood of bullocks, and hills of frankincense, could not have vailed for the removal of sin; but Jesus was cut off for us, and the ause of wrath was cut off at once, for sin was put away forever. erein is wisdom, whereby substitution, the sure and speedy way of tonement, was devised! Herein is condescension, which brought Messiah, he Prince, to wear a crown of thorns, and die upon the cross! Herein s love, which led the Redeemer to lay down his life for his enemies!</p>

<p>The apostle John was privileged to look within the gates of heaven, and n describing what he saw, he begins by saying, "I looked, and, lo, a amb!" This teaches us that the chief object of contemplation in the eavenly state is "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the orld." Nothing else attracted the apostle's attention so much as the erson of that Divine Being, who hath redeemed us by his blood. He is he theme of the songs of all glorified spirits and holy angels. hristian, here is joy for thee; thou hast looked, and thou hast seen he Lamb. Through thy tears thine eyes have seen the Lamb of God taking way thy sins. Rejoice, then. In a little while, when thine eyes shall ave been wiped from tears, thou wilt see the same Lamb exalted on his hrone. It is the joy of thy heart to hold daily fellowship with Jesus; hou shalt have the same joy to a higher degree in heaven; thou shalt njoy the constant vision of his presence; thou shalt dwell with him orever. "I looked, and, lo, a Lamb!" Why, that Lamb is heaven itself; or as good Rutherford says, "Heaven and Christ are the same thing;" to e with Christ is to be in heaven, and to be in heaven is to be with hrist. That prisoner of the Lord very sweetly writes in one of his lowing letters--"O my Lord Jesus Christ, if I could be in heaven ithout thee, it would be a hell; and if I could be in hell, and have hee still, it would be a heaven to me, for thou art all the heaven I ant." It is true, is it not, Christian? Does not thy soul say so?</p>
<p>"Not all the harps above</p>
<p>Can make a heavenly place,</p>
<p>If God his residence remove,</p>

<p>Tell me where you lost the company of Christ, and I will tell you the ost likely place to find him. Have you lost Christ in the closet by estraining prayer? Then it is there you must seek and find him. Did ou lose Christ by sin? You will find Christ in no other way but by the iving up of the sin, and seeking by the Holy Spirit to mortify the ember in which the lust doth dwell. Did you lose Christ by neglecting he Scriptures? You must find Christ in the Scriptures. It is a true roverb, "Look for a thing where you dropped it, it is there." So look or Christ where you lost him, for he has not gone away. But it is hard ork to go back for Christ. Bunyan tells us, the pilgrim found the iece of the road back to the Arbour of Ease, where he lost his roll, he hardest he had ever travelled. Twenty miles onward is easier than o go one mile back for the lost evidence.</p>

How s it that you did not watch him every moment for fear of losing sight f him? Yet, since you have let him go, what a mercy that you are eeking him, even though you mournfully groan, "O that I knew where I ight find him!" Go on seeking, for it is dangerous to be without thy ord.

Our Lord Jesus differs from all other teachers; hey reach the ear, but he instructs the heart; they deal with the utward letter, but he imparts an inward taste for the truth, by which e perceive its savour and spirit. The most unlearned of men become ipe scholars in the school of grace when the Lord Jesus by his Holy pirit unfolds the mysteries of the kingdom to them, and grants the ivine anointing by which they are enabled to behold the invisible. appy are we if we have had our understandings cleared and strengthened y the Master!

Abel was hated by his brother--hated without a cause; and ven so was the Saviour: the natural and carnal man hated the accepted an in whom the Spirit of grace was found, and rested not until his lood had been shed. Abel fell, and sprinkled his altar and sacrifice ith his own blood, and therein sets forth the Lord Jesus slain by the nmity of man while serving as a priest before the Lord.

<p>"Quicken thou me in thy way." The Psalmist confesses that he is dull, eavy, lumpy, all but dead. Perhaps, dear reader, you feel the same. We re so sluggish that the best motives cannot quicken us, apart from the ord himself. What! will not hell quicken me? Shall I think of sinners erishing, and yet not be awakened? Will not heaven quicken me? Can I hink of the reward that awaiteth the righteous, and yet be cold? Will ot death quicken me? Can I think of dying, and standing before my God, nd yet be slothful in my Master's service? Will not Christ's love onstrain me? Can I think of his dear wounds, can I sit at the foot of is cross, and not be stirred with fervency and zeal? It seems so! No ere consideration can quicken us to zeal, but God Himself must do it, ence the cry, "Quicken thou me." The Psalmist breathes out his whole oul in vehement pleadings: his body and his soul unite in prayer.</p>
<p>"Turn away mine eyes," says the body: "Quicken thou me," cries the oul. This is a fit prayer for every day. O Lord, hear it in my case his night.</p>

<p>Samson was thirsty and ready to die. The difficulty was totally ifferent from any which the hero had met before. Merely to get thirst ssuaged is nothing like so great a matter as to be delivered from a housand Philistines! but when the thirst was upon him, Samson felt hat little present difficulty more weighty than the great past ifficulty out of which he had so specially been delivered. It is very sual for God's people, when they have enjoyed a great deliverance, to ind a little trouble too much for them. Samson slays a thousand hilistines, and piles them up in heaps, and then faints for a little ater! Jacob wrestles with God at Peniel, and overcomes Omnipotence tself, and then goes "halting on his thigh!" Strange that there must e a shrinking of the sinew whenever we win the day. As if the Lord ust teach us our littleness, our nothingness, in order to keep us ithin bounds. Samson boasted right loudly when he said, "I have slain  thousand men." His boastful throat soon grew hoarse with thirst, and e betook himself to prayer. God has many ways of humbling his people. ear child of God, if after great mercy you are laid very low, your ase is not an unusual one. When David had mounted the throne of srael, he said, "I am this day weak, though anointed king." You must xpect to feel weakest when you are enjoying your greatest triumph. If od has wrought for you great deliverances in the past, your present ifficulty is only like Samson's thirst, and the Lord will not let you aint, nor suffer the daughter of the uncircumcised to triumph over ou. The road of sorrow is the road to heaven, but there are wells of efreshing water all along the route. So, tried brother, cheer your eart with Samson's words, and rest assured that God will deliver you re long.</p>

<p>This was the wicked question of Satan concerning that upright man of ld, but there are many in the present day concerning whom it might be sked with justice, for they love God after a fashion because he rospers them; but if things went ill with them, they would give up all heir boasted faith in God. If they can clearly see that since the time f their supposed conversion the world has gone prosperously with them, hen they will love God in their poor carnal way; but if they endure dversity, they rebel against the Lord. Their love is the love of the able, not of the host; a love to the cupboard, not to the master of he house. As for the true Christian, he expects to have his reward in he next life, and to endure hardness in this. The promise of the old ovenant was prosperity, but the promise of the new covenant is dversity. Remember Christ's words--"Every branch in me that beareth ot fruit"--What? "He purgeth it, that it may bring forth fruit." If ou bring forth fruit, you will have to endure affliction. "Alas!" you ay, "that is a terrible prospect." But this affliction works out such recious results, that the Christian who is the subject of it must earn to rejoice in tribulations, because as his tribulations abound, o his consolations abound by Christ Jesus. Rest assured, if you are a hild of God, you will be no stranger to the rod. Sooner or later every ar of gold must pass through the fire. Fear not, but rather rejoice hat such fruitful times are in store for you, for in them you will be eaned from earth and made meet for heaven; you will be delivered from linging to the present, and made to long for those eternal things hich are so soon to be revealed to you. When you feel that as regards he present you do serve God for nought, you will then rejoice in the nfinite reward of the future.</p>

<p>Why was Christ chosen out of the people? Speak, my heart, for eart-thoughts are best. Was it not that he might be able to be our rother, in the blest tie of kindred blood? Oh, what relationship there s between Christ and the believer! The believer can say, "I have a rother in heaven; I may be poor, but I have a Brother who is rich, and s a King, and will he suffer me to want while he is on his throne? Oh, o! He loves me; he is my Brother." Believer, wear this blessed hought, like a necklace of diamonds, around the neck of thy memory; ut it, as a golden ring, on the finger of recollection, and use it as he King's own seal, stamping the petitions of thy faith with onfidence of success. He is a brother born for adversity, treat him as uch.</p>
<p>Christ was also chosen out of the people that he might know our wants nd sympathize with us. "He was tempted in all points like as we are, et without sin." In all our sorrows we have his sympathy. Temptation, ain, disappointment, weakness, weariness, poverty--he knows them all, or he has felt all. Remember this, Christian, and let it comfort thee. owever difficult and painful thy road, it is marked by the footsteps f thy Saviour; and even when thou reachest the dark valley of the hadow of death, and the deep waters of the swelling Jordan, thou wilt ind his footprints there. In all places whithersoever we go, he has een our forerunner; each burden we have to carry, has once been laid n the shoulders of Immanuel.</p>

We will remember thy love and its matchless istory. It is ancient as the glory which thou hadst with the Father efore the world was.

<p>Her fault was not that she served: the condition of a servant well ecomes every Christian. "I serve," should be the motto of all the rinces of the royal family of heaven. Nor was it her fault that she ad "much serving." We cannot do too much. Let us do all that we ossibly can; let head, and heart, and hands, be engaged in the aster's service. It was no fault of hers that she was busy preparing a east for the Master. Happy Martha, to have an opportunity of ntertaining so blessed a guest; and happy, too, to have the spirit to hrow her whole soul so heartily into the engagement. Her fault was hat she grew "cumbered with much serving," so that she forgot him, and nly remembered the service. She allowed service to override communion, nd so presented one duty stained with the blood of another. We ought o be Martha and Mary in one: we should do much service, and have much ommunion at the same time. For this we need great grace. It is easier o serve than to commune. Joshua never grew weary in fighting with the malekites; but Moses, on the top of the mountain in prayer, needed two elpers to sustain his hands. The more spiritual the exercise, the ooner we tire in it. The choicest fruits are the hardest to rear: the ost heavenly graces are the most difficult to cultivate. Beloved, hile we do not neglect external things, which are good enough in hemselves, we ought also to see to it that we enjoy living, personal ellowship with Jesus. See to it that sitting at the Saviour's feet is ot neglected, even though it be under the specious pretext of doing im service. The first thing for our soul's health, the first thing for is glory, and the first thing for our own usefulness, is to keep urselves in perpetual communion with the Lord Jesus, and to see that he vital spirituality of our religion is maintained over and above verything else in the world.</p>

Does he bid his saints love one nother? Do it, not because the law says, "Love thy neighbour," but ecause Jesus says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments;" and this is he commandment that he has given unto you, "that ye love one another."

Let us copy them; let us also raise a song of thanksgiving hat we have heard of Jesus and his salvation. They also praised God or what they had seen. There is the sweetest music--what we have xperienced, what we have felt within, what we have made our own--"the hings which we have made touching the King." It is not enough to hear bout Jesus: mere hearing may tune the harp, but the fingers of living aith must create the music. If you have seen Jesus with the God-giving ight of faith, suffer no cobwebs to linger among the harp strings, but oud to the praise of sovereign grace, awake your psaltery and harp. ne point for which they praised God was the agreement between what hey had heard and what they had seen. Observe the last sentence--"As t was told unto them." Have you not found the gospel to be in ourselves just what the Bible said it would be? Jesus said he would ive you rest--have you not enjoyed the sweetest peace in him? He said ou should have joy, and comfort, and life through believing in im--have you not received all these? Are not his ways ways of leasantness, and his paths paths of peace? Surely you can say with the ueen of Sheba, "The half has not been told me." I have found Christ ore sweet than his servants ever said he was. I looked upon his ikeness as they painted it, but it was a mere daub compared with imself; for the King in his beauty outshines all imaginable oveliness. Surely what we have "seen" keeps pace with, nay, far xceeds, what we have "heard." Let us, then, glorify and praise God for  Saviour so precious, and so satisfying.</p>

<p>In our Christian pilgrimage it is well, for the most part, to be ooking forward. Forward lies the crown, and onward is the goal. hether it be for hope, for joy, for consolation, or for the inspiring f our love, the future must, after all, be the grand object of the eye f faith. Looking into the future we see sin cast out, the body of sin nd death destroyed, the soul made perfect, and fit to be a partaker of he inheritance of the saints in light. Looking further yet, the eliever's enlightened eye can see death's river passed, the gloomy tream forded, and the hills of light attained on which standeth the elestial city; he seeth himself enter within the pearly gates, hailed s more than conqueror, crowned by the hand of Christ, embraced in the rms of Jesus, glorified with him, and made to sit together with him on is throne, even as he has overcome and has sat down with the Father on is throne. The thought of this future may well relieve the darkness of he past and the gloom of the present. The joys of heaven will surely ompensate for the sorrows of earth. Hush, hush, my doubts! death is ut a narrow stream, and thou shalt soon have forded it. Time, how hort--eternity, how long! Death, how brief--immortality, how endless! ethinks I even now eat of Eshcol's clusters, and sip of the well which s within the gate. The road is so, so short! I shall soon be there.</p>

All the glorious onsequences of his obedience unto death are the joint riches of all ho are in him, and on whose behalf he accomplished the divine will. ee, he enters into glory, but not for himself alone, for it is ritten, "Whither the Forerunner is for us entered." Heb. 6:20. Does he tand in the presence of God?--"He appears in the presence of God for s." Heb. 9:24. Consider this, believer. You have no right to heaven in ourself: your right lies in Christ. If you are pardoned, it is through is blood; if you are justified, it is through his righteousness; if ou are sanctified, it is because he is made of God unto you anctification; if you shall be kept from falling, it will be because ou are preserved in Christ Jesus; and if you are perfected at the ast, it will be because you are complete in him.

<p>It will always give a Christian the greatest calm, quiet, ease, and eace, to think of the perfect righteousness of Christ. How often are he saints of God downcast and sad!

There are some who are always talking about corruption, and the epravity of the heart, and the innate evil of the soul. This is quite rue, but why not go a little further, and remember that we are "perfect in Christ Jesus." It is no wonder that those who are dwelling pon their own corruption should wear such downcast looks; but surely f we call to mind that "Christ is made unto us righteousness," we hall be of good cheer. What though distresses afflict me, though Satan ssault me, though there may be many things to be experienced before I et to heaven, those are done for me in the covenant of divine grace; here is nothing wanting in my Lord, Christ hath done it all. On the ross he said, "It is finished!" and if it be finished, then am I omplete in him, and can rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of lory, "Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but hat which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is f God by faith." You will not find on this side heaven a holier people han those who receive into their hearts the doctrine of Christ's ighteousness. When the believer says, "I live on Christ alone; I rest n him solely for salvation; and I believe that, however unworthy, I am till saved in Jesus;" then there rises up as a motive of gratitude his thought--"Shall I not live to Christ? Shall I not love him and erve him, seeing that I am saved by his merits?" "The love of Christ onstraineth us," "that they which live should not henceforth live unto hemselves but unto him which died for them." If saved by imputed ighteousness, we shall greatly value imparted righteousness.</p>

<p>The time when Christians begin to sing in the ways of the Lord is when hey first lose their burden at the foot of the Cross.

<p>"Blest Cross! blest Sepulchre! blest rather be</p>
<p>The Man that there was put to shame for me!"</p>
<p>Believer, do you recollect the day when your fetters fell off? Do you emember the place when Jesus met you, and said, "I have loved thee ith an everlasting love; I have blotted out as a cloud thy ransgressions, and as a thick cloud thy sins; they shall not be entioned against thee any more forever." Oh! what a sweet season is hat when Jesus takes away the pain of sin. When the Lord first ardoned my sin, I was so joyous that I could scarce refrain from ancing. I thought on my road home from the house where I had been set t liberty, that I must tell the stones in the street the story of my eliverance. So full was my soul of joy, that I wanted to tell every now-flake that was falling from heaven of the wondrous love of Jesus, ho had blotted out the sins of one of the chief of rebels. But it is ot only at the commencement of the Christian life that believers have eason for song; as long as they live they discover cause to sing in he ways of the Lord, and their experience of his constant ovingkindness leads them to say, "I will bless the Lord at all times: is praise shall continually be in my mouth."

<p>Come, dear readers, let each one of us speak for himself of the onderful love, not of Jonathan, but of Jesus. We will not relate what e have been told, but the things which we have tasted and handled-of he love of Christ. Thy love to me, O Jesus, was wonderful when I was a tranger wandering far from thee, fulfilling the desires of the flesh nd of the mind. Thy love restrained me from committing the sin which s unto death, and withheld me from self-destruction. Thy love held ack the axe when Justice said, "Cut it down! why cumbereth it the round?" Thy love drew me into the wilderness, stripped me there, and ade me feel the guilt of my sin, and the burden of mine iniquity. Thy ove spake thus comfortably to me when, I was sore dismayed--"Come unto e, and I will give thee rest." Oh, how matchless thy love when, in a oment, thou didst wash my sins away, and make my polluted soul, which as crimson with the blood of my nativity, and black with the grime of y transgressions, to be white as the driven snow, and pure as the inest wool. How thou didst commend thy love when thou didst whisper in y ears, "I am thine and thou art mine." Kind were those accents when hou saidst, "The Father himself loveth you." And sweet the moments, assing sweet, when thou declaredst to me "the love of the Spirit." Never shall my soul forget those chambers of fellowship where thou has nveiled thyself to me. Had Moses his cleft in the rock, where he saw he train, the back parts of his God? We, too, have had our clefts in he rock, where we have seen the full splendours of the Godhead in the erson of Christ. Did David remember the tracks of the wild goat, the and of Jordan and the Hermonites? We, too, can remember spots to emory dear, equal to these in blessedness. Precious Lord Jesus, give s a fresh draught of thy wondrous love to begin the month with. Amen.</p>

If e be never so moral, generous, amiable, or patriotic, the rule will ot be altered to make an exception for us.

<p>Persons of merely formal religion cannot understand how we can rejoice hat all our sins are forgiven us for Christ's sake.

But of the Christian it can be said that e does not owe God's justice anything, for Christ has paid the debt is people owed; for this reason the believer owes the more to love. I m a debtor to God's grace and forgiving mercy; but I am no debtor to is justice, for he will never accuse me of a debt already paid. Christ aid, "It is finished!" and by that he meant, that whatever his people wed was wiped away forever from the book of remembrance. Christ, to he uttermost, has satisfied divine justice; the account is settled; he handwriting is nailed to the cross; the receipt is given, and we re debtors to God's justice no longer. But then, because we are not ebtors to our Lord in that sense, we become ten times more debtors to od than we should have been otherwise. Christian, pause and ponder for  moment. What a debtor thou art to divine sovereignty! How much thou west to his disinterested love, for he gave his own Son that he might ie for thee. Consider how much you owe to his forgiving grace, that fter ten thousand affronts he loves you as infinitely as ever. onsider what you owe to his power; how he has raised you from your eath in sin; how he has preserved your spiritual life; how he has kept ou from falling; and how, though a thousand enemies have beset your ath, you have been able to hold on your way.

<p>Your refuge from the avenger of blood.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>It is said that in the land of Canaan, cities of refuge were so rranged, that any man might reach one of them within half a day at the tmost. Even so the word of our salvation is near to us; Jesus is a resent Saviour, and the way to him is short; it is but a simple enunciation of our own merit, and a laying hold of Jesus, to be our ll in all. With regard to the roads to the city of refuge, we are told hat they were strictly preserved, every river was bridged, and every bstruction removed, so that the man who fled might find an easy assage to the city. Once a year the elders went along the roads and aw to their order, so that nothing might impede the flight of any one, nd cause him, through delay, to be overtaken and slain. How graciously o the promises of the gospel remove stumbling blocks from the way! herever there were by-roads and turnings, there were fixed up and-posts, with the inscription upon them--"To the city of refuge!" This is a picture of the road to Christ Jesus. It is no roundabout road f the law; it is no obeying this, that, and the other; it is a traight road: "Believe, and live." It is a road so hard, that no elf-righteous man can ever tread it, but so easy, that every sinner, ho knows himself to be a sinner may by it find his way to heaven. No ooner did the man-slayer reach the outworks of the city than he was afe; it was not necessary for him to pass far within the walls, but he suburbs themselves were sufficient protection. Learn hence, that if ou do but touch the hem of Christ's garment, you shall be made whole; f you do but lay hold upon him with "faith as a grain of mustard eed," you are safe.</p>
<p>"A little genuine grace ensures</p>
<p>The death of all our sins."</p>
<p>Only waste no time, loiter not by the way, for the avenger of blood is wift of foot; and it may be he is at your heels at this still hour of ventide.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>It is a sweet thought that Jesus Christ did not come forth without his ather's permission, authority, consent, and assistance. He was sent of he Father, that he might be the Saviour of men. We are too apt to orget that, while there are distinctions as to the persons in the rinity, there are no distinctions of honour. We too frequently ascribe he honour of our salvation, or at least the depths of its benevolence, ore to Jesus Christ than we do the Father. This is a very great istake. What if Jesus came? Did not his Father send him? If he spake ondrously, did not his Father pour grace into his lips, that he might e an able minister of the new covenant? He who knoweth the Father, and he Son, and the Holy Ghost as he should know them, never setteth one efore another in his love; he sees them at Bethlehem, at Gethsemane, nd on Calvary, all equally engaged in the work of salvation. O hristian, hast thou put thy confidence in the Man Christ Jesus? Hast hou placed thy reliance solely on him? And art thou united with him? hen believe that thou art united unto the God of heaven. Since to the an Christ Jesus thou art brother, and holdest closest fellowship, thou rt linked thereby with God the Eternal, and "the Ancient of days" is hy Father and thy friend. Didst thou ever consider the depth of love n the heart of Jehovah, when God the Father equipped his Son for the reat enterprise of mercy? If not, be this thy day's meditation. The ather sent him! Contemplate that subject. Think how Jesus works what he Father wills. In the wounds of the dying Saviour see the love of he great I AM. Let every thought of Jesus be also connected with the ternal, ever-blessed God, for "It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he ath put him to grief."</p>

<div class="response">
<p>This is a singular way in which to commence a verse--"At that time esus answered." If you will look at the context you will not perceive hat any person had asked him a question, or that he was in onversation with any human being. Yet it is written, "Jesus answered nd said, I thank thee, O Father." When a man answers, he answers a erson who has been speaking to him. Who, then, had spoken to Christ? is Father. Yet there is no record of it; and this should teach us that esus had constant fellowship with his Father, and that God spake into is heart so often, so continually, that it was not a circumstance ingular enough to be recorded. It was the habit and life of Jesus to alk with God. Even as Jesus was, in this world, so are we; let us herefore learn the lesson which this simple statement concerning him eaches us. May we likewise have silent fellowship with the Father, so hat often we may answer him, and though the world wotteth not to whom e speak, may we be responding to that secret voice unheard of any ther ear, which our own ear, opened by the Spirit of God, recognizes ith joy. God has spoken to us, let us speak to God--either to set our eal that God is true and faithful to his promise, or to confess the in of which the Spirit of God has convinced us, or to acknowledge the ercy which God's providence has given, or to express assent to the reat truths which God the Holy Ghost has opened to our understanding. hat a privilege is intimate communion with the Father of our spirits! t is a secret hidden from the world, a joy with which even the nearest riend intermeddleth not. If we would hear the whispers of God's love, ur ear must be purged and fitted to listen to his voice. This very vening may our hearts be in such a state, that when God speaks to us, e, like Jesus, may be prepared at once to answer him.</p>

<p>What multitudes of prayers we have put up from the first moment when we earned to pray. Our first prayer was a prayer for ourselves; we asked hat God would have mercy upon us, and blot out our sin. He heard us. ut when he had blotted out our sins like a cloud, then we had more rayers for ourselves. We have had to pray for sanctifying grace, for onstraining and restraining grace; we have been led to crave for a resh assurance of faith, for the comfortable application of the romise, for deliverance in the hour of temptation, for help in the ime of duty, and for succour in the day of trial. We have been ompelled to go to God for our souls, as constant beggars asking for verything. Bear witness, children of God, you have never been able to et anything for your souls elsewhere. All the bread your soul has aten has come down from heaven, and all the water of which it has rank has flowed from the living rock--Christ Jesus the Lord. Your soul as never grown rich in itself; it has always been a pensioner upon the aily bounty of God; and hence your prayers have ascended to heaven for  range of spiritual mercies all but infinite. Your wants were nnumerable, and therefore the supplies have been infinitely great, and our prayers have been as varied as the mercies have been countless. hen have you not cause to say, "I love the Lord, because he hath heard he voice of my supplication"? For as your prayers have been many, so lso have been God's answers to them. He has heard you in the day of rouble, has strengthened you, and helped you, even when you ishonoured him by trembling and doubting at the mercy-seat. Remember his, and let it fill your heart with gratitude to God, who has thus raciously heard your poor weak prayers. "Bless the Lord, O my soul, nd forget not all his benefits."</p>

<p>As an encouragement cheerfully to offer intercessory prayer, remember hat such prayer is the sweetest God ever hears, for the prayer of hrist is of this character. In all the incense which our Great High riest now puts into the golden censer, there is not a single grain for imself. His intercession must be the most acceptable of all upplications--and the more like our prayer is to Christ's, the sweeter t will be; thus while petitions for ourselves will be accepted, our leadings for others, having in them more of the fruits of the Spirit, ore love, more faith, more brotherly kindness, will be, through the recious merits of Jesus, the sweetest oblation that we can offer to od, the very fat of our sacrifice. Remember, again, that intercessory rayer is exceedingly prevalent. What wonders it has wrought! The Word f God teems with its marvellous deeds. Believer, thou hast a mighty ngine in thy hand, use it well, use it constantly, use it with faith, nd thou shalt surely be a benefactor to thy brethren.

<p>When a person is dear, everything connected with him becomes dear for is sake.

"All thy garments smell of yrrh, and aloes, and cassia," said David, as if the very vestments of he Saviour were so sweetened by his person that he could not but love hem. Certain it is, that there is not a spot where that hallowed foot ath trodden--there is not a word which those blessed lips have ttered--nor a thought which his loving Word has revealed--which is not o us precious beyond all price.

<p>Many persons, if they are asked what they understand by salvation, will eply, "Being saved from hell and taken to heaven." This is one result f salvation, but it is not one tithe of what is contained in that oon. It is true our Lord Jesus Christ does redeem all his people from he wrath to come; he saves them from the fearful condemnation which heir sins had brought upon them; but his triumph is far more complete han this. He saves his people "from their sins." Oh! sweet deliverance rom our worst foes. Where Christ works a saving work, he casts Satan rom his throne, and will not let him be master any longer. No man is a rue Christian if sin reigns in his mortal body. Sin will be in us--it ill never be utterly expelled till the spirit enters glory; but it ill never have dominion. There will be a striving for dominion--a usting against the new law and the new spirit which God has mplanted--but sin will never get the upper hand so as to be absolute onarch of our nature. Christ will be Master of the heart, and sin must e mortified. The Lion of the tribe of Judah shall prevail, and the ragon shall be cast out. Professor! is sin subdued in you? If your ife is unholy your heart is unchanged, and if your heart is unchanged ou are an unsaved person. If the Saviour has not sanctified you, enewed you, given you a hatred of sin and a love of holiness, he has one nothing in you of a saving character. The grace which does not ake a man better than others is a worthless counterfeit. Christ saves is people, not in their sins, but from them. "Without holiness no man hall see the Lord." "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ epart from iniquity." If not saved from sin, how shall we hope to be ounted among his people. Lord, save me now from all evil, and enable e to honour my Saviour.</p>

<p>When David made this enquiry he had just fought the Philistines, and ained a signal victory. The Philistines came up in great hosts, but, y the help of God, David had easily put them to flight. Note, however, hat when they came a second time, David did not go up to fight them ithout enquiring of the Lord. Once he had been victorious, and he ight have said, as many have in other cases, "I shall be victorious gain; I may rest quite sure that if I have conquered once I shall riumph yet again. Wherefore should I tarry to seek at the Lord's ands?" Not so, David. He had gained one battle by the strength of the ord; he would not venture upon another until he had ensured the same. e enquired, "Shall I go up against them?" He waited until God's sign as given. Learn from David to take no step without God. Christian, if hou wouldst know the path of duty, take God for thy compass; if thou ouldst steer thy ship through the dark billows, put the tiller into he hand of the Almighty. Many a rock might be escaped, if we would let ur Father take the helm; many a shoal or quicksand we might well void, if we would leave to his sovereign will to choose and to ommand. The Puritan said, "As sure as ever a Christian carves for imself, he'll cut his own fingers;" this is a great truth. Said nother old divine, "He that goes before the cloud of God's providence oes on a fool's errand;" and so he does. We must mark God's providence eading us; and if providence tarries, tarry till providence comes. He ho goes before providence, will be very glad to run back again.

<p>There are many who know "how to be abased" who have not learned "how to bound." When they are set upon the top of a pinnacle their heads grow izzy, and they are ready to fall. The Christian far oftener disgraces is profession in prosperity than in adversity. It is a dangerous thing o be prosperous. The crucible of adversity is a less severe trial to he Christian than the refining pot of prosperity. Oh, what leanness of oul and neglect of spiritual things have been brought on through the ery mercies and bounties of God! Yet this is not a matter of ecessity, for the apostle tells us that he knew how to abound. When he ad much he knew how to use it. Abundant grace enabled him to bear bundant prosperity. When he had a full sail he was loaded with much allast, and so floated safely. It needs more than human skill to carry he brimming cup of mortal joy with a steady hand, yet Paul had learned hat skill, for he declares, "In all things I am instructed both to be ull and to be hungry." It is a divine lesson to know how to be full, or the Israelites were full once, but while the flesh was yet in their outh, the wrath of God came upon them. Many have asked for mercies hat they might satisfy their own hearts' lust. Fulness of bread has ften made fulness of blood, and that has brought on wantonness of pirit. When we have much of God's providential mercies, it often appens that we have but little of God's grace, and little gratitude or the bounties we have received. We are full and we forget God: atisfied with earth, we are content to do without heaven. Rest assured t is harder to know how to be full than it is to know how to be ungry--so desperate is the tendency of human nature to pride and orgetfulness of God.

<p>Attentively observe the instructive similitude: our sins are like a loud. As clouds are of many shapes and shades, so are our ransgressions. As clouds obscure the light of the sun, and darken the andscape beneath, so do our sins hide from us the light of Jehovah's ace, and cause us to sit in the shadow of death. They are earth-born hings, and rise from the miry places of our nature; and when so ollected that their measure is full, they threaten us with storm and empest. Alas! that, unlike clouds, our sins yield us no genial howers, but rather threaten to deluge us with a fiery flood of estruction. O ye black clouds of sin, how can it be fair weather with ur souls while ye remain?</p>
<p>Let our joyful eye dwell upon the notable act of divine ercy--"blotting out." God himself appears upon the scene, and in ivine benignity, instead of manifesting his anger, reveals his grace: e at once and forever effectually removes the mischief, not by blowing way the cloud, but by blotting it out from existence once for all. gainst the justified man no sin remains, the great transaction of the ross has eternally removed his transgressions from him.

<p>Ever to be remembered is that best and brightest of hours, when first e saw the Lord, lost our burden, received the roll of promise, ejoiced in full salvation, and went on our way in peace. It was spring ime in the soul; the winter was past; the mutterings of Sinai's hunders were hushed; the flashings of its lightnings were no more erceived; God was beheld as reconciled; the law threatened no engeance, justice demanded no punishment. Then the flowers appeared in ur heart; hope, love, peace, and patience sprung from the sod; the yacinth of repentance, the snowdrop of pure holiness, the crocus of olden faith, the daffodil of early love, all decked the garden of the oul. The time of the singing of birds was come, and we rejoiced with hanksgiving; we magnified the holy name of our forgiving God, and our esolve was, "Lord, I am thine, wholly thine; all I am, and all I have,  would devote to thee. Thou hast bought me with thy blood--let me pend myself and be spent in thy service. In life and in death let me e consecrated to thee." How have we kept this resolve? Our espousal ove burned with a holy flame of devoutedness to Jesus--is it the same ow? Might not Jesus well say to us, "I have somewhat against thee, ecause thou hast left thy first love"? Alas! it is but little we have one for our Master's glory. Our winter has lasted all too long. We are s cold as ice when we should feel a summer's glow and bloom with acred flowers. We give to God pence when he deserveth pounds, nay, eserveth our heart's blood to be coined in the service of his church nd of his truth. But shall we continue thus? O Lord, after thou hast o richly blessed us, shall we be ungrateful and become indifferent to hy good cause and work? O quicken us that we may return to our first ove, and do our first works! Send us a genial spring, O Sun of ighteousness.</p>

<p>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also boundeth by Christ.</p>

<p>There is a blessed proportion. The Ruler of Providence bears a pair of cales--in this side he puts his people's trials, and in that he puts heir consolations. When the scale of trial is nearly empty, you will lways find the scale of consolation in nearly the same condition; and hen the scale of trials is full, you will find the scale of onsolation just as heavy. When the black clouds gather most, the light s the more brightly revealed to us. When the night lowers and the empest is coming on, the Heavenly Captain is always closest to his rew. It is a blessed thing, that when we are most cast down, then it s that we are most lifted up by the consolations of the Spirit. One eason is, because trials make more room for consolation. Great hearts an only be made by great troubles. The spade of trouble digs the eservoir of comfort deeper, and makes more room for consolation. God omes into our heart--he finds it full--he begins to break our comforts nd to make it empty; then there is more room for grace. The humbler a an lies, the more comfort he will always have, because he will be more itted to receive it. Another reason why we are often most happy in our roubles, is this--then we have the closest dealings with God. When the arn is full, man can live without God: when the purse is bursting with old, we try to do without so much prayer. But once take our gourds way, and we want our God; once cleanse the idols out of the house, hen we are compelled to honour Jehovah. "Out of the depths have I ried unto thee, O Lord." There is no cry so good as that which comes rom the bottom of the mountains; no prayer half so hearty as that hich comes up from the depths of the soul, through deep trials and fflictions. Hence they bring us to God, and we are happier; for earness to God is happiness. Come, troubled believer, fret not over our heavy troubles, for they are the heralds of weighty mercies.</p>

We cannot ontrol his working; he is most sovereign in all his operations, but re we sufficiently anxious to obtain his help, or sufficiently atchful lest we provoke him to withdraw his aid? Without him we can do othing, but by his almighty energy the most extraordinary results can e produced: everything depends upon his manifesting or concealing his ower. Do we always look up to him both for our inner life and our utward service with the respectful dependence which is fitting? Do we ot too often run before his call and act independently of his aid?

<p>One of the most touching and teaching of the Saviour's miracles is efore us tonight. The woman was very ignorant. She imagined that irtue came out of Christ by a law of necessity, without his knowledge r direct will. Moreover, she was a stranger to the generosity of esus' character, or she would not have gone behind to steal the cure hich he was so ready to bestow. Misery should always place itself ight in the face of mercy. Had she known the love of Jesus' heart, she ould have said, "I have but to put myself where he can see me--his mniscience will teach him my case, and his love at once will work my ure." We admire her faith, but we marvel at her ignorance. After she ad obtained the cure, she rejoiced with trembling: glad was she that he divine virtue had wrought a marvel in her; but she feared lest hrist should retract the blessing, and put a negative upon the grant f his grace: little did she comprehend the fulness of his love! We ave not so clear a view of him as we could wish; we know not the eights and depths of his love; but we know of a surety that he is too ood to withdraw from a trembling soul the gift which it has been able o obtain. But here is the marvel of it: little as was her knowledge, er faith, because it was real faith, saved her, and saved her at once. here was no tedious delay--faith's miracle was instantaneous. If we ave faith as a grain of mustard seed, salvation is our present and ternal possession. If in the list of the Lord's children we are ritten as the feeblest of the family, yet, being heirs through faith, o power, human or devilish, can eject us from salvation. If we dare ot lean our heads upon his bosom with John, yet if we can venture in he press behind him, and touch the hem of his garment, we are made hole. Courage, timid one! thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God."</p>

<p>These words show us that contentment is not a natural propensity of an. "Ill weeds grow apace." Covetousness, discontent, and murmuring re as natural to man as thorns are to the soil. We need not sow histles and brambles; they come up naturally enough, because they are ndigenous to earth: and so, we need not teach men to complain; they omplain fast enough without any education. But the precious things of he earth must be cultivated. If we would have wheat, we must plough nd sow; if we want flowers, there must be the garden, and all the ardener's care. Now, contentment is one of the flowers of heaven, and f we would have it, it must be cultivated; it will not grow in us by ature; it is the new nature alone that can produce it, and even then e must be specially careful and watchful that we maintain and ultivate the grace which God has sown in us. Paul says, "I have earned ... to be content;" as much as to say, he did not know how at ne time. It cost him some pains to attain to the mystery of that great ruth. No doubt he sometimes thought he had learned, and then broke own. And when at last he had attained unto it, and could say, "I have earned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content," he was an ld, grey-headed man, upon the borders of the grave--a poor prisoner hut up in Nero's dungeon at Rome. We might well be willing to endure aul's infirmities, and share the cold dungeon with him, if we too ight by any means attain unto his good degree. Do not indulge the otion that you can be contented without learning, or learn without iscipline. It is not a power that may be exercised naturally, but a cience to be acquired gradually.

Afflictions are often the black foils in which God doth set he jewels of his children's graces, to make them shine the better. It as but a little while ago that on thy knees thou wast saying, "Lord, I ear I have no faith: let me know that I have faith." Was not this eally, though perhaps unconsciously, praying for trials?--for how anst thou know that thou hast faith until thy faith is exercised? epend upon it, God often sends us trials that our graces may be iscovered, and that we may be certified of their existence. Besides, t is not merely discovery, real growth in grace is the result of anctified trials. God often takes away our comforts and our privileges n order to make us better Christians. He trains his soldiers, not in ents of ease and luxury, but by turning them out and using them to orced marches and hard service. He makes them ford through streams, nd swim through rivers, and climb mountains, and walk many a long mile ith heavy knapsacks of sorrow on their backs. Well, Christian, may not his account for the troubles through which thou art passing? Is not he Lord bringing out your graces, and making them grow? Is not this he reason why he is contending with you?</p>
<p>"Trials make the promise sweet;</p>
<p>Trials give new life to prayer;</p>
<p>Trials bring me to his feet,</p>
<p>Lay me low, and keep me there."</p>

<p>It is quite certain that those whom Christ has washed in his precious lood need not make a confession of sin, as culprits or criminals, efore God the Judge, for Christ has forever taken away all their sins n a legal sense, so that they no longer stand where they can be ondemned, but are once for all accepted in the Beloved; but having ecome children, and offending as children, ought they not every day to o before their heavenly Father and confess their sin, and acknowledge heir iniquity in that character? Nature teaches that it is the duty of rring children to make a confession to their earthly father, and the race of God in the heart teaches us that we, as Christians, owe the ame duty to our heavenly Father. We daily offend, and ought not to est without daily pardon. For, supposing that my trespasses against my ather are not at once taken to him to be washed away by the cleansing ower of the Lord Jesus, what will be the consequence? If I have not ought forgiveness and been washed from these offences against my ather, I shall feel at a distance from him; I shall doubt his love to e; I shall tremble at him; I shall be afraid to pray to him: I shall row like the prodigal, who, although still a child, was yet far off rom his father. But if, with a child's sorrow at offending so gracious nd loving a Parent, I go to him and tell him all, and rest not till I ealize that I am forgiven, then I shall feel a holy love to my Father, nd shall go through my Christian career, not only as saved, but as one njoying present peace in God through Jesus Christ my Lord. There is a ide distinction between confessing sin as a culprit, and confessing in as a child. The Father's bosom is the place for penitent onfessions. We have been cleansed once for all, but our feet still eed to be washed from the defilement of our daily walk as children of od.</p>

<p>Prayer is the forerunner of mercy. Turn to sacred history, and you will ind that scarcely ever did a great mercy come to this world unheralded y supplication. You have found this true in your own personal xperience. God has given you many an unsolicited favour, but still reat prayer has always been the prelude of great mercy with you. When ou first found peace through the blood of the cross, you had been raying much, and earnestly interceding with God that he would remove our doubts, and deliver you from your distresses. Your assurance was he result of prayer. When at any time you have had high and rapturous oys, you have been obliged to look upon them as answers to your rayers. When you have had great deliverances out of sore troubles, and ighty helps in great dangers, you have been able to say, "I sought the ord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears." Prayer is lways the preface to blessing. It goes before the blessing as the lessing's shadow. When the sunlight of God's mercies rises upon our ecessities, it casts the shadow of prayer far down upon the plain. Or, o use another illustration, when God piles up a hill of mercies, he imself shines behind them, and he casts on our spirits the shadow of rayer, so that we may rest certain, if we are much in prayer, our leadings are the shadows of mercy. Prayer is thus connected with the lessing to show us the value of it. If we had the blessings without sking for them, we should think them common things; but prayer makes ur mercies more precious than diamonds. The things we ask for are recious, but we do not realize their preciousness until we have sought or them earnestly.</p>
<p>"Prayer makes the darken'd cloud withdraw;</p>
<p>Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw;</p>
<p>Gives exercise to faith and love;</p>
<p>Brings every blessing from above."</p>

<p>This case is an excellent pattern of all cases where spiritual life is igorous.

True grace puts an end to all spiritual onopoly. Andrew first found his own brother Simon, and then others. elationship has a very strong demand upon our first individual fforts. Andrew, thou didst well to begin with Simon. I doubt whether here are not some Christians giving away tracts at other people's ouses who would do well to give away a tract at their own--whether here are not some engaged in works of usefulness abroad who are eglecting their special sphere of usefulness at home. Thou mayst or hou mayst not be called to evangelize the people in any particular ocality, but certainly thou art called to see after thine own ervants, thine own kinsfolk and acquaintance. Let thy religion begin t home. Many tradesmen export their best commodities--the Christian hould not. He should have all his conversation everywhere of the best avour; but let him have a care to put forth the sweetest fruit of piritual life and testimony in his own family. When Andrew went to ind his brother, he little imagined how eminent Simon would become. imon Peter was worth ten Andrews so far as we can gather from sacred istory, and yet Andrew was instrumental in bringing him to Jesus. You ay be very deficient in talent yourself, and yet you may be the means f drawing to Christ one who shall become eminent in grace and service. h! dear friend, you little know the possibilities which are in you. ou may but speak a word to a child, and in that child there may be lumbering a noble heart which shall stir the Christian church in years o come.

<p>A holy character does not avert temptation--Jesus was tempted.

Though you become greatly sanctified by the Holy Ghost, xpect that the great dog of hell will bark at you still. In the haunts f men we expect to be tempted, but even seclusion will not guard us rom the same trial. Jesus Christ was led away from human society into he wilderness, and was tempted of the devil. Solitude has its charms nd its benefits, and may be useful in checking the lust of the eye and he pride of life; but the devil will follow us into the most lovely etreats. Do not suppose that it is only the worldly-minded who have readful thoughts and blasphemous temptations, for even piritual-minded persons endure the same; and in the holiest position e may suffer the darkest temptation. The utmost consecration of spirit ill not insure you against Satanic temptation. Christ was consecrated hrough and through. It was his meat and drink to do the will of him hat sent him: and yet he was tempted! Your hearts may glow with a eraphic flame of love to Jesus, and yet the devil will try to bring ou down to Laodicean lukewarmness. If you will tell me when God ermits a Christian to lay aside his armour, I will tell you when Satan as left off temptation.

<p>We should be abler teachers of others, and less liable to be carried bout by every wind of doctrine, if we sought to have a more ntelligent understanding of the Word of God. As the Holy Ghost, the uthor of the Scriptures is he who alone can enlighten us rightly to nderstand them, we should constantly ask his teaching, and his uidance into all truth. When the prophet Daniel would interpret ebuchadnezzar's dream, what did he do? He set himself to earnest rayer that God would open up the vision. The apostle John, in his ision at Patmos, saw a book sealed with seven seals which none was ound worthy to open, or so much as to look upon. The book was fterwards opened by the Lion of the tribe of Judah, who had prevailed o open it; but it is written first--"I wept much." The tears of John, hich were his liquid prayers, were, so far as he was concerned, the acred keys by which the folded book was opened. Therefore, if, for our own and others' profiting, you desire to be "filled with the nowledge of God's will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding," remember that prayer is your best means of study: like Daniel, you hall understand the dream, and the interpretation thereof, when you ave sought unto God; and like John you shall see the seven seals of recious truth unloosed, after you have wept much. Stones are not roken, except by an earnest use of the hammer; and the stone-breaker ust go down on his knees. Use the hammer of diligence, and let the nee of prayer be exercised, and there is not a stony doctrine in evelation which is useful for you to understand, which will not fly nto shivers under the exercise of prayer and faith. You may force your ay through anything with the leverage of prayer.

<p>That strength which God gives to his Josephs is real strength; it is ot a boasted valour, a fiction, a thing of which men talk, but which nds in smoke; it is true--divine strength. Why does Joseph stand gainst temptation? Because God gives him aid. There is nought that we an do without the power of God. All true strength comes from "the ighty God of Jacob." Notice in what a blessedly familiar way God gives his strength to Joseph--"The arms of his hands were made strong by the ands of the mighty God of Jacob." Thus God is represented as putting is hands on Joseph's hands, placing his arms on Joseph's arms. Like as  father teaches his children, so the Lord teaches them that fear him. e puts his arms upon them. Marvellous condescension! God Almighty, ternal, Omnipotent, stoops from his throne and lays his hand upon the hild's hand, stretching his arm upon the arm of Joseph, that he may be ade strong! This strength was also covenant strength, for it is scribed to "the mighty God of Jacob." Now, wherever you read of the od of Jacob in the Bible, you should remember the covenant with Jacob. hristians love to think of God's covenant. All the power, all the race, all the blessings, all the mercies, all the comforts, all the hings we have, flow to us from the well-head, through the covenant. If here were no covenant, then we should fail indeed; for all grace roceeds from it, as light and heat from the sun. No angels ascend or escend, save upon that ladder which Jacob saw, at the top of which tood a covenant God. Christian, it may be that the archers have sorely rieved you, and shot at you, and wounded you, but still your bow bides in strength; be sure, then, to ascribe all the glory to Jacob's od.</p>

God's rod of mercy is ver in his hands outstretched; his sword of justice is in its cabbard, held down by that pierced hand of love which bled for the ins of men. "The Lord is slow to anger," because he is great in power. e is truly great in power who hath power over himself. When God's ower doth restrain himself, then it is power indeed: the power that inds omnipotence is omnipotence surpassed. A man who has a strong mind an bear to be insulted long, and only resents the wrong when a sense f right demands his action. The weak mind is irritated at a little: he strong mind bears it like a rock which moveth not, though a housand breakers dash upon it, and cast their pitiful malice in spray pon its summit. God marketh his enemies, and yet he bestirs not imself, but holdeth in his anger. If he were less divine than he is, e would long ere this have sent forth the whole of his thunders, and mptied the magazines of heaven; he would long ere this have blasted he earth with the wondrous fires of its lower regions, and man would ave been utterly destroyed; but the greatness of his power brings us ercy. Dear reader, what is your state this evening? Can you by humble aith look to Jesus, and say, "My substitute, thou art my rock, my rust"? Then, beloved, be not afraid of God's power; for by faith you ave fled to Christ for refuge, the power of God need no more terrify ou, than the shield and sword of the warrior need terrify those whom e loves.

There is only one voice which can speak to the louds, and bid them beget the rain. Who sendeth down the rain upon the arth? Who scattereth the showers upon the green herb? Do not I, the ord? So grace is the gift of God, and is not to be created by man. It s also needed grace. What would the ground do without showers? You may reak the clods, you may sow your seeds, but what can you do without he rain? As absolutely needful is the divine blessing. In vain you abour, until God the plenteous shower bestows, and sends salvation own. Then, it is plenteous grace. "I will send them showers." It does ot say, "I will send them drops," but "showers." So it is with grace. f God gives a blessing, he usually gives it in such a measure that here is not room enough to receive it. Plenteous grace! Ah! we want lenteous grace to keep us humble, to make us prayerful, to make us oly; plenteous grace to make us zealous, to preserve us through this ife, and at last to land us in heaven. We cannot do without saturating howers of grace. Again, it is seasonable grace. "I will cause the hower to come down in his season." What is thy season this morning? Is t the season of drought? Then that is the season for showers. Is it a eason of great heaviness and black clouds? Then that is the season for howers. "As thy days so shall thy strength be." And here is a varied lessing. "I will give thee showers of blessing." The word is in the lural. All kinds of blessings God will send. All God's blessings go ogether, like links in a golden chain. If he gives converting grace, e will also give comforting grace. He will send "showers of blessing." Look up today, O parched plant, and open thy leaves and flowers for a eavenly watering.</p>

Bear patiently the rod for a season, and under the arkness still trust in God, for his love burneth towards thee. God oves the church with a love too deep for human imagination: he loves er with all his infinite heart. Therefore let her sons be of good ourage; she cannot be far from prosperity to whom God speaketh "good ords and comfortable words." What these comfortable words are the rophet goes on to tell us: "I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion ith a great jealousy." The Lord loves his church so much that he annot bear that she should go astray to others; and when she has done o, he cannot endure that she should suffer too much or too heavily. He ill not have his enemies afflict her: he is displeased with them ecause they increase her misery. When God seems most to leave his hurch, his heart is warm towards her. History shows that whenever God ses a rod to chasten his servants, he always breaks it afterwards, as f he loathed the rod which gave his children pain. "Like as a father itieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him." God hath ot forgotten us because he smites--his blows are no evidences of want f love. If this is true of his church collectively, it is of necessity rue also of each individual member. You may fear that the Lord has assed you by, but it is not so: he who counts the stars, and calls hem by their names, is in no danger of forgetting his own children. He nows your case as thoroughly as if you were the only creature he ever ade, or the only saint he ever loved. Approach him and be at peace.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to pass over a country after a storm has spent itself; o smell the freshness of the herbs after the rain has passed away, and o note the drops while they glisten like purest diamonds in the unlight. That is the position of a Christian. He is going through a and where the storm has spent itself upon his Saviour's head, and if here be a few drops of sorrow falling, they distil from clouds of ercy, and Jesus cheers him by the assurance that they are not for his estruction. But how terrible is it to witness the approach of a empest: to note the forewarnings of the storm; to mark the birds of eaven as they droop their wings; to see the cattle as they lay their eads low in terror; to discern the face of the sky as it groweth lack, and look to the sun which shineth not, and the heavens which are ngry and frowning! How terrible to await the dread advance of a urricane--such as occurs, sometimes, in the tropics--to wait in errible apprehension till the wind shall rush forth in fury, tearing p trees from their roots, forcing rocks from their pedestals, and urling down all the dwelling-places of man! And yet, sinner, this is our present position. No hot drops have as yet fallen, but a shower of ire is coming. No terrible winds howl around you, but God's tempest is athering its dread artillery. As yet the water-floods are dammed up by ercy, but the flood-gates shall soon be opened: the thunderbolts of od are yet in his storehouse, but lo! the tempest hastens, and how wful shall that moment be when God, robed in vengeance, shall march orth in fury! Where, where, where, O sinner, wilt thou hide thy head, r whither wilt thou flee? O that the hand of mercy may now lead you to hrist! He is freely set before you in the gospel: his riven side is he rock of shelter. Thou knowest thy need of him; believe in him, cast hyself upon him, and then the fury shall be overpast forever.</p>

<p>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, nd went down to Joppa.</p>

<p>Instead of going to Nineveh to preach the Word, as God bade him, Jonah isliked the work, and went down to Joppa to escape from it. There are ccasions when God's servants shrink from duty. But what is the onsequence? What did Jonah lose by his conduct? He lost the presence nd comfortable enjoyment of God's love. When we serve our Lord Jesus s believers should do, our God is with us; and though we have the hole world against us, if we have God with us, what does it matter? ut the moment we start back, and seek our own inventions, we are at ea without a pilot. Then may we bitterly lament and groan out, "O my od, where hast thou gone? How could I have been so foolish as to shun hy service, and in this way to lose all the bright shinings of thy ace? This is a price too high. Let me return to my allegiance, that I ay rejoice in thy presence." In the next place, Jonah lost all peace f mind. Sin soon destroys a believer's comfort. It is the poisonous pas tree, from whose leaves distil deadly drops which destroy the life f joy and peace. Jonah lost everything upon which he might have drawn or comfort in any other case. He could not plead the promise of divine rotection, for he was not in God's ways; he could not say, "Lord, I eet with these difficulties in the discharge of my duty, therefore elp me through them." He was reaping his own deeds; he was filled with is own ways. Christian, do not play the Jonah, unless you wish to have ll the waves and the billows rolling over your head. You will find in he long run that it is far harder to shun the work and will of God han to at once yield yourself to it. Jonah lost his time, for he had o go to Nineveh after all. It is hard to contend with God; let us ield ourselves at once.</p>

I do nothing whatever towards my wn preservation, except what God himself first does in me. Whatever I ave, all my goodness is of the Lord alone. Wherein I sin, that is my wn; but wherein I act rightly, that is of God, wholly and completely. f I have repulsed a spiritual enemy, the Lord's strength nerved my rm. Do I live before men a consecrated life? It is not I, but Christ ho liveth in me. Am I sanctified? I did not cleanse myself: God's Holy pirit sanctifies me. Am I weaned from the world? I am weaned by God's hastisements sanctified to my good. Do I grow in knowledge? The great nstructor teaches me. All my jewels were fashioned by heavenly art. I ind in God all that I want; but I find in myself nothing but sin and isery. "He only is my rock and my salvation." Do I feed on the Word? hat Word would be no food for me unless the Lord made it food for my oul, and helped me to feed upon it. Do I live on the manna which comes own from heaven? What is that manna but Jesus Christ himself ncarnate, whose body and whose blood I eat and drink? Am I continually eceiving fresh increase of strength? Where do I gather my might? My elp cometh from heaven's hills: without Jesus I can do nothing. As a ranch cannot bring forth fruit except it abide in the vine, no more an I, except I abide in him.

When a man sees himself to be altogether ost and ruined, covered all over with the defilement of sin, and in no art free from pollution; when he disclaims all righteousness of his wn, and pleads guilty before the Lord, then he is clean through the lood of Jesus, and the grace of God. Hidden, unfelt, unconfessed niquity is the true leprosy; but when sin is seen and felt, it has eceived its deathblow, and the Lord looks with eyes of mercy upon the oul afflicted with it. Nothing is more deadly than self-righteousness, r more hopeful than contrition. We must confess that we are "nothing lse but sin," for no confession short of this will be the whole truth; nd if the Holy Spirit be at work with us, convincing us of sin, there ill be no difficulty about making such an acknowledgment--it will pring spontaneously from our lips. What comfort does the text afford o truly awakened sinners: the very circumstance which so grievously iscouraged them is here turned into a sign and symptom of a hopeful tate! Stripping comes before clothing; digging out the foundation is he first thing in building--and a thorough sense of sin is one of the arliest works of grace in the heart.

That rom the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he might sweat great rops of blood, that he might be spit upon, pierced, mocked, rent sunder, and crushed beneath the pains of death. His goings forth as ur Surety were from everlasting. Pause, my soul, and wonder! Thou hast oings forth in the person of Jesus "from everlasting." Not only when hou wast born into the world did Christ love thee, but his delights ere with the sons of men before there were any sons of men. Often did e think of them; from everlasting to everlasting he had set his ffection upon them. What! my soul, has he been so long about thy alvation, and will not he accomplish it? Has he from everlasting been oing forth to save me, and will he lose me now? What! Has he carried e in his hand, as his precious jewel, and will he now let me slip from etween his fingers?

I am sure he would not have loved me so long if he had ot been a changeless Lover. If he could grow weary of me, he would ave been tired of me long before now. If he had not loved me with a ove as deep as hell, and as strong as death, he would have turned from e long ago.

This I know, I had ather have God for my banker than all the Rothschilds. My Lord never ails to honour his promises; and when we bring them to his throne, he ever sends them back unanswered. Therefore I will wait only at his oor, for he ever opens it with the hand of munificent grace. At this our I will try him anew. But we have "expectations" beyond this life. e shall die soon; and then our "expectation is from him."

<p>The thunders of the law and the terrors of judgment are all used to ring us to Christ; but the final victory is effected by ovingkindness. The prodigal set out to his father's house from a sense f need; but his father saw him a great way off, and ran to meet him; o that the last steps he took towards his father's house were with the iss still warm upon his cheek, and the welcome still musical in his ars.</p>
<p>"Law and terrors do but harden</p>
<p>All the while they work alone;</p>
<p>But a sense of blood-bought pardon</p>
<p>Will dissolve a heart of stone."</p>
<p>The Master came one night to the door, and knocked with the iron hand f the law; the door shook and trembled upon its hinges; but the man iled every piece of furniture which he could find against the door, or he said, "I will not admit the man." The Master turned away, but y-and-bye he came back, and with his own soft hand, using most that art where the nail had penetrated, he knocked again--oh, so softly and enderly. This time the door did not shake, but, strange to say, it pened, and there upon his knees the once unwilling host was found ejoicing to receive his guest. "Come in, come in; thou hast so knocked hat my bowels are moved for thee. I could not think of thy pierced and leaving its blood-mark on my door, and of thy going away ouseless, Thy head filled with dew, and thy locks with the drops of he night.' I yield, I yield, thy love has won my heart." So in every ase: lovingkindness wins the day. What Moses with the tablets of stone ould never do, Christ does with his pierced hand. Such is the doctrine f effectual calling. Do I understand it experimentally? Can I say, "He rew me, and I followed on, glad to confess the voice divine?"

What effect does the doctrine of election have upon any man ntil the Spirit of God enters into him? Election is a dead letter in y consciousness until the Spirit of God calls me out of darkness into arvellous light. Then through my calling, I see my election, and nowing myself to be called of God, I know myself to have been chosen n the eternal purpose. A covenant was made with the Lord Jesus Christ, y his Father; but what avails that covenant to us until the Holy pirit brings us its blessings, and opens our hearts to receive them? here hang the blessings on the nail--Christ Jesus; but being short of tature, we cannot reach them; the Spirit of God takes them down and ands them to us, and thus they become actually ours. Covenant lessings in themselves are like the manna in the skies, far out of ortal reach, but the Spirit of God opens the windows of heaven and catters the living bread around the camp of the spiritual Israel. hrist's finished work is like wine stored in the wine-vat; through nbelief we can neither draw nor drink. The Holy Spirit dips our vessel nto this precious wine, and then we drink; but without the Spirit we re as truly dead in sin as though the Father never had elected, and hough the Son had never bought us with his blood.

Idlers may indulge a fond onceit of their abilities, because they are untried; but the earnest orker soon learns his own weakness. If you seek humility, try hard ork; if you would know your nothingness, attempt some great thing for esus. If you would feel how utterly powerless you are apart from the iving God, attempt especially the great work of proclaiming the nsearchable riches of Christ, and you will know, as you never knew efore, what a weak unworthy thing you are. Although the apostle thus new and confessed his weakness, he was never perplexed as to the ubject of his ministry. From his first sermon to his last, Paul reached Christ, and nothing but Christ. He lifted up the cross, and xtolled the Son of God who bled thereon. Follow his example in all our personal efforts to spread the glad tidings of salvation, and let "Christ and him crucified" be your ever recurring theme. The Christian hould be like those lovely spring flowers which, when the sun is hining, open their golden cups, as if saying, "Fill us with thy eams!" but when the sun is hidden behind a cloud, they close their ups and droop their heads. So should the Christian feel the sweet nfluence of Jesus; Jesus must be his sun, and he must be the flower hich yields itself to the Sun of Righteousness. Oh! to speak of Christ lone, this is the subject which is both "seed for the sower, and bread or the eater."

<p>Comfort thyself, tried believer, with this thought: God saith, "I have hosen thee in the furnace of affliction." Does not the word come like  soft shower, assuaging the fury of the flame? Yea, is it not an sbestos armour, against which the heat hath no power? Let affliction ome--God has chosen me. Poverty, thou mayst stride in at my door, but od is in the house already, and he has chosen me. Sickness, thou mayst ntrude, but I have a balsam ready--God has chosen me. Whatever befalls e in this vale of tears, I know that he has "chosen" me. If, believer, hou requirest still greater comfort, remember that you have the Son of an with you in the furnace. In that silent chamber of yours, there itteth by your side One whom thou hast not seen, but whom thou lovest; nd ofttimes when thou knowest it not, he makes all thy bed in thy ffliction, and smooths thy pillow for thee. Thou art in poverty; but n that lovely house of thine the Lord of life and glory is a frequent isitor. He loves to come into these desolate places, that he may visit hee. Thy friend sticks closely to thee. Thou canst not see him, but hou mayst feel the pressure of his hands. Dost thou not hear his oice? Even in the valley of the shadow of death he says, "Fear not, I m with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God." Remember that noble peech of Caesar: "Fear not, thou carriest Caesar and all his fortune." Fear not, Christian; Jesus is with thee. In all thy fiery trials, his resence is both thy comfort and safety. He will never leave one whom e has chosen for his own. "Fear not, for I am with thee," is his sure ord of promise to his chosen ones in the "furnace of affliction." Wilt hou not, then, take fast hold of Christ, and say--</p>
<p>"Through floods and flames, if Jesus lead,</p>
<p>I'll follow where he goes."</p>

<p>He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>As the Spirit of God descended upon the Lord Jesus, the head, so he lso, in measure, descends upon the members of the mystical body. His escent is to us after the same fashion as that in which it fell upon ur Lord. There is often a singular rapidity about it; or ever we are ware, we are impelled onward and heavenward beyond all expectation. et is there none of the hurry of earthly haste, for the wings of the ove are as soft as they are swift. Quietness seems essential to many piritual operations; the Lord is in the still small voice, and like he dew, his grace is distilled in silence. The dove has ever been the hosen type of purity, and the Holy Spirit is holiness itself. Where he ometh, everything that is pure and lovely, and of good report, is made o abound, and sin and uncleanness depart. Peace reigns also where the oly Dove comes with power; he bears the olive branch which shows that he waters of divine wrath are assuaged. Gentleness is a sure result of he Sacred Dove's transforming power: hearts touched by his benign nfluence are meek and lowly henceforth and forever. Harmlessness ollows, as a matter of course; eagles and ravens may hunt their rey--the turtledove can endure wrong, but cannot inflict it. We must e harmless as doves. The dove is an apt picture of love, the voice of he turtle is full of affection; and so, the soul visited by the lessed Spirit, abounds in love to God, in love to the brethren, and in ove to sinners; and above all, in love to Jesus. The brooding of the pirit of God upon the face of the deep, first produced order and life, nd in our hearts, he causes and fosters new life and light. Blessed pirit, as thou didst rest upon our dear Redeemer, even so rest upon us rom this time forward and forever.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>If none of God's saints were poor and tried, we should not know half so ell the consolations of divine grace. When we find the wanderer who as not where to lay his head, who yet can say, "Still will I trust in he Lord;" when we see the pauper starving on bread and water, who till glories in Jesus; when we see the bereaved widow overwhelmed in ffliction, and yet having faith in Christ, oh! what honour it reflects n the gospel. God's grace is illustrated and magnified in the poverty nd trials of believers. Saints bear up under every discouragement, elieving that all things work together for their good, and that out of pparent evils a real blessing shall ultimately spring--that their God ill either work a deliverance for them speedily, or most assuredly upport them in the trouble, as long as he is pleased to keep them in t. This patience of the saints proves the power of divine grace. There s a lighthouse out at sea: it is a calm night--I cannot tell whether he edifice is firm; the tempest must rage about it, and then I shall now whether it will stand. So with the Spirit's work: if it were not n many occasions surrounded with tempestuous waters, we should not now that it was true and strong; if the winds did not blow upon it, we hould not know how firm and secure it was. The master-works of God are hose men who stand in the midst of difficulties, stedfast, nmoveable,--</p>
<p>"Calm mid the bewildering cry,</p>
<p>Confident of victory."</p>
<p>He who would glorify his God must set his account upon meeting with any trials. No man can be illustrious before the Lord unless his onflicts be many. If then, yours be a much-tried path, rejoice in it, ecause you will the better show forth the all-sufficient grace of God. s for his failing you, never dream of it--hate the thought. The God ho has been sufficient until now, should be trusted to the end.</p>

<p>Sheba's queen was amazed at the sumptuousness of Solomon's table. She ost all heart when she saw the provision of a single day; and she arvelled equally at the company of servants who were feasted at the oyal board. But what is this to the hospitalities of the God of grace? en thousand thousand of his people are daily fed; hungry and thirsty, hey bring large appetites with them to the banquet, but not one of hem returns unsatisfied; there is enough for each, enough for all, nough for evermore. Though the host that feed at Jehovah's table is ountless as the stars of heaven, yet each one has his portion of meat. hink how much grace one saint requires, so much that nothing but the nfinite could supply him for one day; and yet the Lord spreads his able, not for one, but many saints, not for one day, but for many ears; not for many years only, but for generation after generation. bserve the full feasting spoken of in the text, the guests at mercy's anquet are satisfied, nay, more "abundantly satisfied;" and that not ith ordinary fare, but with fatness, the peculiar fatness of God's own ouse; and such feasting is guaranteed by a faithful promise to all hose children of men who put their trust under the shadow of Jehovah's ings.

<p>There are many ways of promoting Christian wakefulness. Among the rest, et me strongly advise Christians to converse together concerning the ays of the Lord. Christian and Hopeful, as they journeyed towards the elestial City, said to themselves, "To prevent drowsiness in this lace, let us fall into good discourse." Christian enquired, "Brother, here shall we begin?" And Hopeful answered, "Where God began with us." Then Christian sang this song--</p>
<p>"When saints do sleepy grow, let them come hither,</p>
<p>And hear how these two pilgrims talk together;</p>
<p>Yea, let them learn of them, in any wise,</p>
<p>Thus to keep open their drowsy slumb'ring eyes.</p>
<p>Saints' fellowship, if it be managed well,</p>
<p>Keeps them awake, and that in spite of hell."</p>
<p>Christians who isolate themselves and walk alone, are very liable to row drowsy. Hold Christian company, and you will be kept wakeful by t, and refreshed and encouraged to make quicker progress in the road o heaven. But as you thus take "sweet counsel" with others in the ways f God, take care that the theme of your converse is the Lord Jesus. et the eye of faith be constantly looking unto him; let your heart be ull of him; let your lips speak of his worth. Friend, live near to the ross, and thou wilt not sleep. Labour to impress thyself with a deep ense of the value of the place to which thou art going. If thou ememberest that thou art going to heaven, thou wilt not sleep on the oad. If thou thinkest that hell is behind thee, and the devil pursuing hee, thou wilt not loiter. Would the manslayer sleep with the avenger f blood behind him, and the city of refuge before him? Christian, wilt hou sleep whilst the pearly gates are open--the songs of angels aiting for thee to join them--a crown of gold ready for thy brow? Ah! o; in holy fellowship continue to watch and pray that ye enter not nto temptation.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>What does this sweet prayer teach me? It shall be my evening's etition; but first let it yield me an instructive meditation. The text nforms me first of all that David had his doubts; for why should he ray, "Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation," if he were not sometimes xercised with doubts and fears? Let me, then, be of good cheer, for I m not the only saint who has to complain of weakness of faith. If avid doubted, I need not conclude that I am no Christian because I ave doubts. The text reminds me that David was not content while he ad doubts and fears, but he repaired at once to the mercy-seat to pray or assurance; for he valued it as much fine gold. I too must labour fter an abiding sense of my acceptance in the Beloved, and must have o joy when his love is not shed abroad in my soul. When my Bridegroom s gone from me, my soul must and will fast. I learn also that David new where to obtain full assurance. He went to his God in prayer, rying, "Say unto my soul I am thy salvation." I must be much alone ith God if I would have a clear sense of Jesus' love. Let my prayers ease, and my eye of faith will grow dim. Much in prayer, much in eaven; slow in prayer, slow in progress. I notice that David would not e satisfied unless his assurance had a divine source. "Say unto my oul." Lord, do thou say it! Nothing short of a divine testimony in the oul will ever content the true Christian. Moreover, David could not est unless his assurance had a vivid personality about it. "Say unto y soul, I am thy salvation." Lord, if thou shouldst say this to all he saints, it were nothing, unless thou shouldst say it to me. Lord, I ave sinned; I deserve not thy smile; I scarcely dare to ask it; but h! say to my soul, even to my soul, "I am thy salvation." Let me have  present, personal, infallible, indisputable sense that I am thine, nd that thou art mine.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Regeneration is a subject which lies at the very basis of salvation, nd we should be very diligent to take heed that we really are "born gain," for there are many who fancy they are, who are not. Be assured hat the name of a Christian is not the nature of a Christian; and that eing born in a Christian land, and being recognized as professing the hristian religion is of no avail whatever, unless there be something ore added to it--the being "born again," is a matter so mysterious, hat human words cannot describe it. "The wind bloweth where it isteth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence t cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the pirit." Nevertheless, it is a change which is known and felt: known by orks of holiness, and felt by a gracious experience. This great work s supernatural. It is not an operation which a man performs for imself: a new principle is infused, which works in the heart, renews he soul, and affects the entire man. It is not a change of my name, ut a renewal of my nature, so that I am not the man I used to be, but  new man in Christ Jesus. To wash and dress a corpse is a far ifferent thing from making it alive: man can do the one, God alone can o the other. If you have then, been "born again," your acknowledgment ill be, "O Lord Jesus, the everlasting Father, thou art my spiritual arent; unless thy Spirit had breathed into me the breath of a new, oly, and spiritual life, I had been to this day dead in trespasses and ins.' My heavenly life is wholly derived from thee, to thee I ascribe t. My life is hid with Christ in God.' It is no longer I who live, but hrist who liveth in me." May the Lord enable us to be well assured on his vital point, for to be unregenerate is to be unsaved, unpardoned, ithout God, and without hope.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>It is an old and common saying, that "coming events cast their shadows efore them;" the wise man teaches us that a haughty heart is the rophetic prelude of evil. Pride is as safely the sign of destruction s the change of mercury in the weather-glass is the sign of rain; and ar more infallibly so than that. When men have ridden the high horse, estruction has always overtaken them. Let David's aching heart show hat there is an eclipse of a man's glory when he dotes upon his own reatness. 2 Sam. 24:10. See Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty builder of abylon, creeping on the earth, devouring grass like oxen, until his ails had grown like bird's claws, and his hair like eagle's feathers. an. 4:33. Pride made the boaster a beast, as once before it made an ngel a devil. God hates high looks, and never fails to bring them own. All the arrows of God are aimed at proud hearts. O Christian, is hine heart haughty this evening? For pride can get into the hristian's heart as well as into the sinner's; it can delude him into reaming that he is "rich and increased in goods, and hath need of othing." Art thou glorying in thy graces or thy talents? Art thou roud of thyself, that thou hast had holy frames and sweet experiences? ark thee, reader, there is a destruction coming to thee also. Thy launting poppies of self-conceit will be pulled up by the roots, thy ushroom graces will wither in the burning heat, and thy elf-sufficiency shall become as straw for the dunghill. If we forget o live at the foot of the cross in deepest lowliness of spirit, God ill not forget to make us smart under his rod. A destruction will come o thee, O unduly exalted believer, the destruction of thy joys and of hy comforts, though there can be no destruction of thy soul. herefore, "He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."</p>

With aith I can do all things; without faith I shall neither have the nclination nor the power to do anything in the service of God.

Poor Little-faith could not have fought "Apollyon;" it needed "Christian" to do that. Poor Little-faith could ot have slain "Giant Despair;" it required "Great-heart's" arm to nock that monster down. Little faith will go to heaven most certainly, ut it often has to hide itself in a nut-shell, and it frequently loses ll but its jewels. Little-faith says, "It is a rough road, beset with harp thorns, and full of dangers; I am afraid to go;" but Great-faith emembers the promise, "Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; as thy days, o shall thy strength be:" and so she boldly ventures.

Freedom from sickness and the pains of mortality as never promised them; but when their Lord drew up the charter of rivileges, he included chastisements amongst the things to which they hould inevitably be heirs. Trials are a part of our lot; they were redestinated for us in Christ's last legacy. So surely as the stars re fashioned by his hands, and their orbits fixed by him, so surely re our trials allotted to us: he has ordained their season and their lace, their intensity and the effect they shall have upon us. Good men ust never expect to escape troubles; if they do, they will be isappointed, for none of their predecessors have been without them. ark the patience of Job; remember Abraham, for he had his trials, and y his faith under them, he became the "Father of the faithful."

But although tribulation is thus the path of God's hildren, they have the comfort of knowing that their Master has raversed it before them; they have his presence and sympathy to cheer hem, his grace to support them, and his example to teach them how to ndure; and when they reach "the kingdom," it will more than make mends for the "much tribulation" through which they passed to enter t.</p>

<p>To every matter there is a bright as well as a dark side. Rachel was verwhelmed with the sorrow of her own travail and death; Jacob, though eeping the mother's loss, could see the mercy of the child's birth. It s well for us if, while the flesh mourns over trials, our faith riumphs in divine faithfulness. Samson's lion yielded honey, and so ill our adversities, if rightly considered. The stormy sea feeds ultitudes with its fishes; the wild wood blooms with beauteous lowerets; the stormy wind sweeps away the pestilence, and the biting rost loosens the soil. Dark clouds distil bright drops, and black arth grows gay flowers. A vein of good is to be found in every mine of vil. Sad hearts have peculiar skill in discovering the most isadvantageous point of view from which to gaze upon a trial; if there ere only one slough in the world, they would soon be up to their necks n it, and if there were only one lion in the desert they would hear it oar. About us all there is a tinge of this wretched folly, and we are pt, at times, like Jacob, to cry, "All these things are against me." Faith's way of walking is to cast all care upon the Lord, and then to nticipate good results from the worst calamities. Like Gideon's men, he does not fret over the broken pitcher, but rejoices that the lamp lazes forth the more. Out of the rough oyster-shell of difficulty she xtracts the rare pearl of honour, and from the deep ocean-caves of istress she uplifts the priceless coral of experience. When her flood f prosperity ebbs, she finds treasures hid in the sands; and when her un of delight goes down, she turns her telescope of hope to the starry romises of heaven.

Seeing thou hast ived with him, and lived in him here, thou shalt abide with him orever.</p>

<p>"Moab settled on his lees, he hath not been emptied from vessel to essel." Give a man wealth; let his ships bring home continually rich reights; let the winds and waves appear to be his servants to bear his essels across the bosom of the mighty deep; let his lands yield bundantly: let the weather be propitious to his crops; let ninterrupted success attend him; let him stand among men as a uccessful merchant; let him enjoy continued health; allow him with raced nerve and brilliant eye to march through the world, and live appily; give him the buoyant spirit; let him have the song perpetually n his lips; let his eye be ever sparkling with joy--and the natural onsequence of such an easy state to any man, let him be the best hristian who ever breathed, will be presumption; even David said, "I hall never be moved;" and we are not better than David, nor half so ood. Brother, beware of the smooth places of the way; if you are reading them, or if the way be rough, thank God for it. If God should lways rock us in the cradle of prosperity; if we were always dandled n the knees of fortune; if we had not some stain on the alabaster illar; if there were not a few clouds in the sky; if we had not some itter drops in the wine of this life, we should become intoxicated ith pleasure, we should dream "we stand;" and stand we should, but it ould be upon a pinnacle; like the man asleep upon the mast, each oment we should be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>We bless God, then, for our afflictions; we thank him for our changes; e extol his name for losses of property; for we feel that had he not hastened us thus, we might have become too secure. Continued worldly rosperity is a fiery trial.</p>

<p>It may be of great service to us, before we fall asleep, to remember his mournful fact, for it may lead us to set loose by earthly things. here is nothing very pleasant in the recollection that we are not bove the shafts of adversity, but it may humble us and prevent our oasting like the Psalmist in our morning's portion. "My mountain tandeth firm: I shall never be moved." It may stay us from taking too eep root in this soil from which we are so soon to be transplanted nto the heavenly garden. Let us recollect the frail tenure upon which e hold our temporal mercies. If we would remember that all the trees f earth are marked for the woodman's axe, we should not be so ready to uild our nests in them. We should love, but we should love with the ove which expects death, and which reckons upon separations. Our dear elations are but loaned to us, and the hour when we must return them o the lender's hand may be even at the door. The like is certainly rue of our worldly goods. Do not riches take to themselves wings and ly away? Our health is equally precarious. Frail flowers of the field, e must not reckon upon blooming forever. There is a time appointed for eakness and sickness, when we shall have to glorify God by suffering, nd not by earnest activity. There is no single point in which we can ope to escape from the sharp arrows of affliction; out of our few days here is not one secure from sorrow. Man's life is a cask full of itter wine; he who looks for joy in it had better seek for honey in an cean of brine. Beloved reader, set not your affections upon things of arth: but seek those things which are above, for here the moth evoureth, and the thief breaketh through, but there all joys are erpetual and eternal. The path of trouble is the way home. Lord, make his thought a pillow for many a weary head!</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Beware of light thoughts of sin. At the time of conversion, the onscience is so tender, that we are afraid of the slightest sin. Young onverts have a holy timidity, a godly fear lest they should offend gainst God. But alas! very soon the fine bloom upon these first ripe ruits is removed by the rough handling of the surrounding world: the ensitive plant of young piety turns into a willow in after life, too liant, too easily yielding. It is sadly true, that even a Christian ay grow by degrees so callous, that the sin which once startled him oes not alarm him in the least. By degrees men get familiar with sin. he ear in which the cannon has been booming will not notice slight ounds. At first a little sin startles us; but soon we say, "Is it not  little one?" Then there comes another, larger, and then another, ntil by degrees we begin to regard sin as but a little ill; and then ollows an unholy presumption: "We have not fallen into open sin. True, e tripped a little, but we stood upright in the main. We may have ttered one unholy word, but as for the most of our conversation, it as been consistent." So we palliate sin; we throw a cloak over it; we all it by dainty names. Christian, beware how thou thinkest lightly of in. Take heed lest thou fall by little and little. Sin, a little hing? Is it not a poison? Who knows its deadliness? Sin, a little hing? Do not the little foxes spoil the grapes? Doth not the tiny oral insect build a rock which wrecks a navy? Do not little strokes ell lofty oaks? Will not continual droppings wear away stones? Sin, a ittle thing? It girded the Redeemer's head with thorns, and pierced is heart! It made him suffer anguish, bitterness, and woe. Could you eigh the least sin in the scales of eternity, you would fly from it as rom a serpent, and abhor the least appearance of evil. Look upon all in as that which crucified the Saviour, and you will see it to be "exceeding sinful."</p>

<p>The surpassing grace of God is seen very clearly in that we were not nly sought, but sought out. Men seek for a thing which is lost upon he floor of the house, but in such a case there is only seeking, not eeking out. The loss is more perplexing and the search more ersevering when a thing is sought out. We were mingled with the mire: e were as when some precious piece of gold falls into the sewer, and en gather out and carefully inspect a mass of abominable filth, and ontinue to stir and rake, and search among the heap until the treasure s found. Or, to use another figure, we were lost in a labyrinth; we andered hither and thither, and when mercy came after us with the ospel, it did not find us at the first coming, it had to search for us nd seek us out; for we as lost sheep were so desperately lost, and had andered into such a strange country, that it did not seem possible hat even the Good Shepherd should track our devious roamings. Glory be o unconquerable grace, we were sought out! No gloom could hide us, no ilthiness could conceal us, we were found and brought home. Glory be o infinite love, God the Holy Spirit restored us!</p>
<p>The lives of some of God's people, if they could be written would fill s with holy astonishment. Strange and marvellous are the ways which od used in their case to find his own. Blessed be his name, he never elinquishes the search until the chosen are sought out effectually. hey are not a people sought today and cast away to-morrow. lmightiness and wisdom combined will make no failures, they shall be alled, "Sought out!" That any should be sought out is matchless grace, ut that we should be sought out is grace beyond degree! We can find no eason for it but God's own sovereign love, and can only lift up our eart in wonder, and praise the Lord that this night we wear the name f "Sought out."</p>

For those who believe in Jesus are the ons of God. Whose work are you doing? You are sure to serve your aster, for he whom you serve is thereby owned to be your lord. What ompany do you keep? If you belong to Jesus, you will fraternize with hose who wear the livery of the cross. "Birds of a feather flock ogether." What is your conversation? Is it heavenly or is it earthly? hat have you learned of your Master?--for servants learn much from heir masters to whom they are apprenticed. If you have served your ime with Jesus, it will be said of you, as it was of Peter and John, "They took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."</p>
<p>We press the question, "To whom belongest thou?" Answer honestly before ou give sleep to your eyes. If you are not Christ's you are in a hard ervice--Run away from your cruel master!

"Nothing venture, nothing in," is the old proverb, and in your case the venture is no great one. f you sit still in sullen despair, no one can pity you when your ruin omes; but if you die with mercy sought, if such a thing were possible, ou would be the object of universal sympathy. None escape who refuse o look to Jesus; but you know that, at any rate, some are saved who elieve in him, for certain of your own acquaintances have received ercy: then why not you? The Ninevites said, "Who can tell?" Act upon he same hope, and try the Lord's mercy.

She has ust strength to reach the edge of the ark, she can hardly alight upon t, and is ready to drop, when Noah puts forth his hand and pulls her n unto him. Mark that: "pulled her in unto him." She did not fly right n herself, but was too fearful, or too weary to do so. She flew as far s she could, and then he put forth his hand and pulled her in unto im. This act of mercy was shown to the wandering dove, and she was not hidden for her wanderings. Just as she was she was pulled into the rk. So you, seeking sinner, with all your sin, will be received. "Only eturn"--those are God's two gracious words--"only return." What! othing else? No, "only return."

Take eed that thou gloriest not in thy graces, but let all thy glorying and onfidence be in Christ and his strength, for only so canst thou be ept from falling. Be much more in prayer. Spend longer time in holy doration. Read the Scriptures more earnestly and constantly. Watch our lives more carefully. Live nearer to God. Take the best examples or your pattern.

"Of his fulness have all e received, and grace for grace." He seems only to have in order to ispense to us. He stands like the fountain, always flowing, but only unning in order to supply the empty pitchers and the thirsty lips hich draw nigh unto it. Like a tree, he bears sweet fruit, not to hang n boughs, but to be gathered by those who need. Grace, whether its ork be to pardon, to cleanse, to preserve, to strengthen, to nlighten, to quicken, or to restore, is ever to be had from him freely nd without price; nor is there one form of the work of grace which he as not bestowed upon his people. As the blood of the body, though lowing from the heart, belongs equally to every member, so the nfluences of grace are the inheritance of every saint united to the amb; and herein there is a sweet communion between Christ and his hurch, inasmuch as they both receive the same grace. Christ is the ead upon which the oil is first poured; but the same oil runs to the ery skirts of the garments, so that the meanest saint has an unction f the same costly moisture as that which fell upon the head. This is rue communion when the sap of grace flows from the stem to the branch, nd when it is perceived that the stem itself is sustained by the very ourishment which feeds the branch. As we day by day receive grace from esus, and more constantly recognize it as coming from him, we shall ehold him in communion with us, and enjoy the felicity of communion ith him. Let us make daily use of our riches, and ever repair to him s to our own Lord in covenant, taking from him the supply of all we eed with as much boldness as men take money from their own purse.</p>

What! do saints want warning against uch sins as these? Yes, they do. The whitest robes, unless their urity be preserved by divine grace, will be defiled by the blackest pots. Experienced Christian, boast not in your experience; you will rip yet if you look away from him who is able to keep you from alling. Ye whose love is fervent, whose faith is constant, whose hopes re bright, say not, "We shall never sin," but rather cry, "Lead us not nto temptation." There is enough tinder in the heart of the best of en to light a fire that shall burn to the lowest hell, unless God hall quench the sparks as they fall. Who would have dreamed that ighteous Lot could be found drunken, and committing uncleanness? azael said, "Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?" and e are very apt to use the same self-righteous question. May infinite isdom cure us of the madness of self-confidence.</p>

<p>Remember the poor.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Why does God allow so many of his children to be poor? He could make hem all rich if he pleased; he could lay bags of gold at their doors; e could send them a large annual income; or he could scatter round heir houses abundance of provisions, as once he made the quails lie in eaps round the camp of Israel, and rained bread out of heaven to feed hem. There is no necessity that they should be poor, except that he ees it to be best. "The cattle upon a thousand hills are his"--he ould supply them; he could make the richest, the greatest, and the ightiest bring all their power and riches to the feet of his children, or the hearts of all men are in his control. But he does not choose to o so; he allows them to suffer want, he allows them to pine in penury nd obscurity. Why is this? There are many reasons: one is, to give us, ho are favoured with enough, an opportunity of showing our love to esus. We show our love to Christ when we sing of him and when we pray o him; but if there were no sons of need in the world we should lose he sweet privilege of evidencing our love, by ministering in lms-giving to his poorer brethren; he has ordained that thus we should rove that our love standeth not in word only, but in deed and in ruth. If we truly love Christ, we shall care for those who are loved y him. Those who are dear to him will be dear to us. Let us then look pon it not as a duty but as a privilege to relieve the poor of the ord's flock--remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, "Inasmuch as ye ave done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done t unto me." Surely this assurance is sweet enough, and this motive trong enough to lead us to help others with a willing hand and a oving heart--recollecting that all we do for his people is graciously ccepted by Christ as done to himself.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>This is the seventh of the beatitudes: and seven was the number of erfection among the Hebrews. It may be that the Saviour placed the eacemaker the seventh upon the list because he most nearly approaches he perfect man in Christ Jesus. He who would have perfect blessedness, o far as it can be enjoyed on earth, must attain to this seventh enediction, and become a peacemaker. There is a significance also in he position of the text. The verse which precedes it speaks of the lessedness of "the pure in heart: for they shall see God." It is well o understand that we are to be "first pure, then peaceable." Our eaceableness is never to be a compact with sin, or toleration of evil. e must set our faces like flints against everything which is contrary o God and his holiness: purity being in our souls a settled matter, we an go on to peaceableness. Not less does the verse that follows seem o have been put there on purpose. However peaceable we may be in this orld, yet we shall be misrepresented and misunderstood: and no marvel, or even the Prince of Peace, by his very peacefulness, brought fire pon the earth. He himself, though he loved mankind, and did no ill, as "despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with rief." Lest, therefore, the peaceable in heart should be surprised hen they meet with enemies, it is added in the following verse, "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for heirs is the kingdom of heaven." Thus, the peacemakers are not only ronounced to be blessed, but they are compassed about with blessings. ord, give us grace to climb to this seventh beatitude! Purify our inds that we may be "first pure, then peaceable," and fortify our ouls, that our peaceableness may not lead us into cowardice and espair, when for thy sake we are persecuted.</p>

God the Father loves Jesus without any hange. Christian, take this for your comfort, that there is no change n Jesus Christ's love to those who rest in him. Yesterday you were on abor's top, and you said, "He loves me:" today you are in the valley f humiliation, but he loves you still the same. On the hill Mizar, and mong the Hermons, you heard his voice, which spake so sweetly with the urtle-notes of love; and now on the sea, or even in the sea, when all is waves and billows go over you, his heart is faithful to his ancient hoice. The Father loves the Son without any end, and thus does the Son ove his people. Saint, thou needest not fear the loosing of the silver ord, for his love for thee will never cease. Rest confident that even own to the grave Christ will go with you, and that up again from it he ill be your guide to the celestial hills. Moreover, the Father loves he Son without any measure, and the same immeasurable love the Son estows upon his chosen ones. The whole heart of Christ is dedicated to is people. He "loved us and gave himself for us." His is a love which asseth knowledge. Ah! we have indeed an immutable Saviour, a precious aviour, one who loves without measure, without change, without eginning, and without end, even as the Father loves him!

<p>Christian, take good care of thy faith; for recollect faith is the only ay whereby thou canst obtain blessings. If we want blessings from God, othing can fetch them down but faith. Prayer cannot draw down answers rom God's throne except it be the earnest prayer of the man who elieves. Faith is the angelic messenger between the soul and the Lord esus in glory.

Faith is the telegraphic wire which inks earth and heaven--on which God's messages of love fly so fast, hat before we call he answers, and while we are yet speaking he hears s. But if that telegraphic wire of faith be snapped, how can we eceive the promise? Am I in trouble?--I can obtain help for trouble by aith. Am I beaten about by the enemy?--my soul on her dear Refuge eans by faith. But take faith away--in vain I call to God. There is no oad betwixt my soul and heaven. In the deepest wintertime faith is a oad on which the horses of prayer may travel--aye, and all the better or the biting frost; but blockade the road, and how can we communicate ith the Great King? Faith links me with divinity. Faith clothes me ith the power of God. Faith engages on my side the omnipotence of ehovah. Faith ensures every attribute of God in my defence. It helps e to defy the hosts of hell. It makes me march triumphant over the ecks of my enemies. But without faith how can I receive anything of he Lord? Let not him that wavereth--who is like a wave of the ea--expect that he will receive anything of God!

Jesus fills our conscience till it is at perfect peace; ur judgment with persuasion of the certainty of his teachings; our emory with recollections of what he has done, and our imagination with he prospects of what he is yet to do. As Ruth was "sufficed, and eft," so is it with us. We have had deep draughts; we have thought hat we could take in all of Christ; but when we have done our best we ave had to leave a vast remainder. We have sat at the table of the ord's love, and said, "Nothing but the infinite can ever satisfy me; I m such a great sinner that I must have infinite merit to wash my sin way;" but we have had our sin removed, and found that there was merit o spare; we have had our hunger relieved at the feast of sacred love, nd found that there was a redundance of spiritual meat remaining. here are certain sweet things in the Word of God which we have not njoyed yet, and which we are obliged to leave for awhile; for we are ike the disciples to whom Jesus said, "I have yet many things to say nto you, but ye cannot bear them now."

Few masters could enture to say, "If you would practise my teaching, imitate my life;" but as the life of Jesus is the exact transcript of perfect virtue, he an point to himself as the paragon of holiness, as well as the teacher f it. The Christian should take nothing short of Christ for his model. nder no circumstances ought we to be content unless we reflect the race which was in him. As a husband, the Christian is to look upon the ortrait of Christ Jesus, and he is to paint according to that copy. he true Christian is to be such a husband as Christ was to his church. he love of a husband is special. The Lord Jesus cherishes for the hurch a peculiar affection, which is set upon her above the rest of ankind: "I pray for them, I pray not for the world." The elect church s the favourite of heaven, the treasure of Christ, the crown of his ead, the bracelet of his arm, the breastplate of his heart, the very entre and core of his love. A husband should love his wife with a onstant love, for thus Jesus loves his church. He does not vary in his ffection.

A husband should love his wife with an nduring love, for nothing "shall be able to separate us from the love f God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

<p>It was humble prayer. Luke says he knelt, but another evangelist says e "fell on his face." Where, then, must be thy place, thou humble ervant of the great Master? What dust and ashes should cover thy head! umility gives us good foot-hold in prayer. There is no hope of revalence with God unless we abase ourselves that he may exalt us in ue time.</p>
<p>It was filial prayer. "Abba, Father." You will find it a stronghold in he day of trial to plead your adoption. You have no rights as a ubject, you have forfeited them by your treason; but nothing can orfeit a child's right to a father's protection. Be not afraid to say, "My Father, hear my cry."</p>
<p>Observe that it was persevering prayer. He prayed three times. Cease ot until you prevail. Be as the importunate widow, whose continual oming earned what her first supplication could not win. Continue in rayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The mental pressure arising from our Lord's struggle with temptation, o forced his frame to an unnatural excitement, that his pores sent orth great drops of blood which fell down to the ground. This proves ow tremendous must have been the weight of sin when it was able to rush the Saviour so that he distilled great drops of blood! This emonstrates the mighty power of his love. It is a very pretty bservation of old Isaac Ambrose that the gum which exudes from the ree without cutting is always the best. This precious camphire-tree ielded most sweet spices when it was wounded under the knotty whips, nd when it was pierced by the nails on the cross; but see, it giveth orth its best spice when there is no whip, no nail, no wound. This ets forth the voluntariness of Christ's sufferings, since without a ance the blood flowed freely. No need to put on the leech, or apply he knife; it flows spontaneously. No need for the rulers to cry, "Spring up, O well;" of itself it flows in crimson torrents. If men uffer great pain of mind apparently the blood rushes to the heart. The heeks are pale; a fainting fit comes on; the blood has gone inward as f to nourish the inner man while passing through its trial. But see ur Saviour in his agony; he is so utterly oblivious of self, that nstead of his agony driving his blood to the heart to nourish himself, t drives it outward to bedew the earth. The agony of Christ, inasmuch s it pours him out upon the ground, pictures the fulness of the ffering which he made for men.</p>
<p>Do we not perceive how intense must have been the wrestling through hich he passed, and will we not hear its voice to us? "Ye have not yet esisted unto blood, striving against sin." Behold the great Apostle nd High Priest of our profession, and sweat even to blood rather than ield to the great tempter of your souls.</p>

The old rocks could tell of chaos and order, and the handiwork f God in successive stages of creation's drama; and cannot we talk of od's decrees, of God's great work in ancient times, in all that he did or his church in the days of old? If the stones were to speak, they ould tell of their breaker, how he took them from the quarry, and made hem fit for the temple, and cannot we tell of our glorious Breaker, ho broke our hearts with the hammer of his word, that he might build s into his temple? If the stones should cry out they would magnify heir builder, who polished them and fashioned them after the imilitude of a palace; and shall not we talk of our Architect and uilder, who has put us in our place in the temple of the living God? f the stones could cry out, they might have a long, long story to tell y way of memorial, for many a time hath a great stone been rolled as a emorial before the Lord; and we too can testify of Ebenezers, stones f help, pillars of remembrance. The broken stones of the law cry out gainst us, but Christ himself, who has rolled away the stone from the oor of the sepulchre, speaks for us. Stones might well cry out, but we ill not let them: we will hush their noise with ours; we will break orth into sacred song, and bless the majesty of the Most High, all our ays glorifying him who is called by Jacob the Shepherd and Stone of srael.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>The Saviour was "a man of sorrows," but every thoughtful mind has iscovered the fact that down deep in his innermost soul he carried an nexhaustible treasury of refined and heavenly joy. Of all the human ace, there was never a man who had a deeper, purer, or more abiding eace than our Lord Jesus Christ. "He was anointed with the oil of ladness above his fellows." His vast benevolence must, from the very ature of things, have afforded him the deepest possible delight, for enevolence is joy. There were a few remarkable seasons when this joy anifested itself. "At that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I hank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth." Christ had his songs, hough it was night with him; though his face was marred, and his ountenance had lost the lustre of earthly happiness, yet sometimes it as lit up with a matchless splendour of unparalleled satisfaction, as e thought upon the recompense of the reward, and in the midst of the ongregation sang his praise unto God. In this, the Lord Jesus is a lessed picture of his church on earth. At this hour the church expects o walk in sympathy with her Lord along a thorny road; through much ribulation she is forcing her way to the crown. To bear the cross is er office, and to be scorned and counted an alien by her mother's hildren is her lot; and yet the church has a deep well of joy, of hich none can drink but her own children. There are stores of wine, nd oil, and corn, hidden in the midst of our Jerusalem, upon which the aints of God are evermore sustained and nurtured; and sometimes, as in ur Saviour's case, we have our seasons of intense delight, for "There s a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of our God." Exiles though we be, we rejoice in our King; yea, in him we exceedingly ejoice, while in his name we set up our banners.</p>

<p>How constantly our Master used the title, the "Son of man!"

He prefers to call himself the Son f man. Let us learn a lesson of humility from our Saviour; let us ever court great titles nor proud degrees. There is here, however, a ar sweeter thought. Jesus loved manhood so much, that he delighted to onour it; and since it is a high honour, and indeed, the greatest ignity of manhood, that Jesus is the Son of man, he is wont to display his name, that he may as it were hang royal stars upon the breast of anhood, and show forth the love of God to Abraham's seed. Son of an--whenever he said that word, he shed a halo round the head of dam's children. Yet there is perhaps a more precious thought still. esus Christ called himself the Son of man to express his oneness and ympathy with his people. He thus reminds us that he is the one whom we ay approach without fear. As a man, we may take to him all our griefs nd troubles, for he knows them by experience; in that he himself hath uffered as the "Son of man," he is able to succour and comfort us. All ail, thou blessed Jesus! inasmuch as thou art evermore using the sweet ame which acknowledges that thou art a brother and a near kinsman, it s to us a dear token of thy grace, thy humility, thy love.</p>

They had all been warned of the danger, and had promised to die ather than leave their Master; and yet they were seized with sudden anic, and took to their heels.

<p>This woman gained comfort in her misery by thinking great thoughts of hrist.

She hought him one who kept so good a table that all that she needed would nly be a crumb in comparison; yet remember, what she wanted was to ave the devil cast out of her daughter. It was a very great thing to er, but she had such a high esteem of Christ, that she said, "It is othing to him, it is but a crumb for Christ to give." This is the oyal road to comfort. Great thoughts of your sin alone will drive you o despair; but great thoughts of Christ will pilot you into the haven f peace. "My sins are many, but oh! it is nothing to Jesus to take hem all away. The weight of my guilt presses me down as a giant's foot ould crush a worm, but it is no more than a grain of dust to him, ecause he has already borne its curse in his own body on the tree. It ill be but a small thing for him to give me full remission, although t will be an infinite blessing for me to receive it." The woman opens er soul's mouth very wide, expecting great things of Jesus, and he ills it with his love. Dear reader, do the same. She confessed what hrist laid at her door, but she laid fast hold upon him, and drew rguments even out of his hard words; she believed great things of him, nd she thus overcame him. She won the victory by believing in Him. Her ase is an instance of prevailing faith; and if we would conquer like er, we must imitate her tactics.</p>

<p>The love of Christ in its sweetness, its fulness, its greatness, its aithfulness, passeth all human comprehension.

<p>"O love, thou fathomless abyss!"</p>
<p>for this love of Christ is indeed measureless and fathomless; none can ttain unto it. Before we can have any right idea of the love of Jesus, e must understand his previous glory in its height of majesty, and his ncarnation upon the earth in all its depths of shame. But who can tell s the majesty of Christ? When he was enthroned in the highest heavens e was very God of very God; by him were the heavens made, and all the osts thereof. His own almighty arm upheld the spheres; the praises of herubim and seraphim perpetually surrounded him; the full chorus of he hallelujahs of the universe unceasingly flowed to the foot of his hrone: he reigned supreme above all his creatures, God over all, lessed forever. Who can tell his height of glory then? And who, on the ther hand, can tell how low he descended? To be a man was something, o be a man of sorrows was far more; to bleed, and die, and suffer, hese were much for him who was the Son of God; but to suffer such nparalleled agony--to endure a death of shame and desertion by his ather, this is a depth of condescending love which the most inspired ind must utterly fail to fathom. Herein is love! and truly it is love hat "passeth knowledge." O let this love fill our hearts with adoring ratitude, and lead us to practical manifestations of its power.</p>

No, our Master's experience teaches s that suffering is necessary, and the true-born child of God must ot, would not, escape it if he might. But there is one very comforting hought in the fact of Christ's "being made perfect through uffering"--it is, that he can have complete sympathy with us. "He is ot an high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our nfirmities." In this sympathy of Christ we find a sustaining power. ne of the early martyrs said, "I can bear it all, for Jesus suffered, nd he suffers in me now; he sympathizes with me, and this makes me trong." Believer, lay hold of this thought in all times of agony. Let he thought of Jesus strengthen you as you follow in his steps.

Just so far as the Lord shall ive us grace to suffer for Christ, to suffer with Christ, just so far oes he honour us. The jewels of a Christian are his afflictions. The egalia of the kings whom God hath anointed are their troubles, their orrows, and their griefs. Let us not, therefore, shun being honoured. et us not turn aside from being exalted. Griefs exalt us, and troubles ift us up. "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him."</p>

<p>Why did Jesus suffer himself to be enrolled amongst sinners? This onderful condescension was justified by many powerful reasons. In such  character he could the better become their advocate. In some trials here is an identification of the counsellor with the client, nor can hey be looked upon in the eye of the law as apart from one another. ow, when the sinner is brought to the bar, Jesus appears there imself. He stands to answer the accusation. He points to his side, his ands, his feet, and challenges Justice to bring anything against the inners whom he represents; he pleads his blood, and pleads so riumphantly, being numbered with them and having a part with them, hat the Judge proclaims, "Let them go their way; deliver them from oing down into the pit, for he hath found a ransom." Our Lord Jesus as numbered with the transgressors in order that they might feel their earts drawn towards him. Who can be afraid of one who is written in he same list with us? Surely we may come boldly to him, and confess ur guilt. He who is numbered with us cannot condemn us. Was he not put own in the transgressor's list that we might be written in the red oll of the saints? He was holy, and written among the holy; we were uilty, and numbered among the guilty; he transfers his name from onder list to this black indictment, and our names are taken from the ndictment and written in the roll of acceptance, for there is a omplete transfer made between Jesus and his people. All our estate of isery and sin Jesus has taken; and all that Jesus has comes to us. His ighteousness, his blood, and everything that he hath he gives us as ur dowry.

<p>The spouse who fondly loves her absent husband longs for his return; a ong protracted separation from her lord is a semi-death to her spirit: nd so with souls who love the Saviour much, they must see his face, hey cannot bear that he should be away upon the mountains of Bether, nd no more hold communion with them. A reproaching glance, an uplifted inger will be grievous to loving children, who fear to offend their ender father, and are only happy in his smile. Beloved, it was so once ith you. A text of Scripture, a threatening, a touch of the rod of ffliction, and you went to your Father's feet, crying, "Show me herefore thou contendest with me?" Is it so now? Are you content to ollow Jesus afar off? Can you contemplate suspended communion with hrist without alarm? Can you bear to have your Beloved walking ontrary to you, because you walk contrary to him? Have your sins eparated between you and your God, and is your heart at rest? O let me ffectionately warn you, for it is a grievous thing when we can live ontentedly without the present enjoyment of the Saviour's face. Let us abour to feel what an evil thing this is--little love to our own dying aviour, little joy in our precious Jesus, little fellowship with the eloved! Hold a true Lent in your souls, while you sorrow over your ardness of heart. Do not stop at sorrow! Remember where you first eceived salvation. Go at once to the cross. There, and there only, can ou get your spirit quickened. No matter how hard, how insensible, how ead we may have become, let us go again in all the rags and poverty, nd defilement of our natural condition. Let us clasp that cross, let s look into those languid eyes, let us bathe in that fountain filled ith blood--this will bring back to us our first love; this will estore the simplicity of our faith, and the tenderness of our heart.</p>

<p>Pilate delivered our Lord to the lictors to be scourged. The Roman courge was a most dreadful instrument of torture. It was made of the inews of oxen, and sharp bones were inter-twisted every here and there mong the sinews; so that every time the lash came down these pieces of one inflicted fearful laceration, and tore off the flesh from the one. The Saviour was, no doubt, bound to the column, and thus beaten. e had been beaten before; but this of the Roman lictors was probably he most severe of his flagellations. My soul, stand here and weep over is poor stricken body.</p>
<p>Believer in Jesus, can you gaze upon him without tears, as he stands efore you the mirror of agonizing love? He is at once fair as the lily or innocence, and red as the rose with the crimson of his own blood. s we feel the sure and blessed healing which his stripes have wrought n us, does not our heart melt at once with love and grief?

See how she leaps at once to im; there are no prefatory words; she does not even mention his name; he is in the heart of her theme at once, for she speaks of him who was he only him in the world to her. How bold is her love! It was much ondescension which permitted the weeping penitent to anoint his feet ith spikenard--it was rich love which allowed the gentle Mary to sit t his feet and learn of him--but here, love, strong, fervent love, spires to higher tokens of regard, and closer signs of fellowship. sther trembled in the presence of Ahasuerus, but the spouse in joyful iberty of perfect love knows no fear. If we have received the same ree spirit, we also may ask the like. By kisses we suppose to be ntended those varied manifestations of affection by which the believer s made to enjoy the love of Jesus. The kiss of reconciliation we njoyed at our conversion, and it was sweet as honey dropping from the omb. The kiss of acceptance is still warm on our brow, as we know that e hath accepted our persons and our works through rich grace. The kiss f daily, present communion is that which we pant after to be repeated ay after day, till it is changed into the kiss of reception, which emoves the soul from earth, and the kiss of consummation which fills t with the joy of heaven.

Every lossoming flower warns you that it is time to seek the Lord; be not ut of tune with nature, but let your heart bud and bloom with holy esires. Do you tell me that the warm blood of youth leaps in your eins? then, I entreat you, give your vigour to the Lord.

Salvation is priceless, let it come hen it may, but oh! an early salvation has a double value in it. Young en and maidens, since you may perish ere you reach your prime, "It is ime to seek the Lord."

<p>He had never been slow of speech when he could bless the sons of men, ut he would not say a single word for himself. "Never man spake like his man," and never man was silent like him.

Had he so entirely surrendered himself hat he would not interfere in his own behalf, even in the minutest egree, but be bound and slain an unstruggling, uncomplaining victim? as this silence a type of the defencelessness of sin? Nothing can be aid in palliation or excuse of human guilt; and, therefore, he who ore its whole weight stood speechless before his judge. Is not patient ilence the best reply to a gainsaying world? Calm endurance answers ome questions infinitely more conclusively than the loftiest loquence. The best apologists for Christianity in the early days were ts martyrs. The anvil breaks a host of hammers by quietly bearing heir blows. Did not the silent Lamb of God furnish us with a grand xample of wisdom? Where every word was occasion for new blasphemy, it as the line of duty to afford no fuel for the flame of sin. The mbiguous and the false, the unworthy and mean, will ere long overthrow nd confute themselves, and therefore the true can afford to be quiet, nd finds silence to be its wisdom. Evidently our Lord, by his silence, urnished a remarkable fulfilment of prophecy. A long defence of imself would have been contrary to Isaiah's prediction: "He is led as  lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so e openeth not his mouth." By his quiet he conclusively proved himself o be the true Lamb of God. As such we salute him this morning. Be with s, Jesus, and in the silence of our heart, let us hear the voice of hy love.</p>

<p>Here a confession of sin common to all the elect people of God. They ave all fallen, and therefore, in common chorus, they all say, from he first who entered heaven to the last who shall enter there, "All we ike sheep have gone astray." The confession, while thus unanimous, is lso special and particular: "We have turned every one to his own way." There is a peculiar sinfulness about every one of the individuals; all re sinful, but each one with some special aggravation not found in his ellow. It is the mark of genuine repentance that while it naturally ssociates itself with other penitents, it also takes up a position of oneliness. "We have turned every one to his own way," is a confession hat each man had sinned against light peculiar to himself, or sinned ith an aggravation which he could not perceive in others. This onfession is unreserved; there is not a word to detract from its orce, nor a syllable by way of excuse. The confession is a giving up f all pleas of self-righteousness. It is the declaration of men who re consciously guilty--guilty with aggravations, guilty without xcuse: they stand with their weapons of rebellion broken in pieces, nd cry, "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one o his own way." Yet we hear no dolorous wailings attending this onfession of sin; for the next sentence makes it almost a song. "The ord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." It is the most grievous entence of the three, but it overflows with comfort. Strange is it hat where misery was concentrated mercy reigned; where sorrow reached er climax weary souls find rest. The Saviour bruised is the healing of ruised hearts. See how the lowliest penitence gives place to assured onfidence through simply gazing at Christ on the cross!</p>

<p>But let us comfort ourselves with this thought, that in our case, as in imon's, it is not our cross, but Christ's cross which we carry.

<p>You carry the cross after him. You have blessed company; your path is arked with the footprints of your Lord. The mark of his blood-red houlder is upon that heavy burden. 'Tis his cross, and he goes before ou as a shepherd goes before his sheep. Take up your cross daily, and ollow him.</p>
<p>Do not forget, also, that you bear this cross in partnership. It is the pinion of some that Simon only carried one end of the cross, and not he whole of it. That is very possible; Christ may have carried the eavier part, against the transverse beam, and Simon may have borne the ighter end. Certainly it is so with you; you do but carry the light nd of the cross, Christ bore the heavier end.</p>
<p>And remember, though Simon had to bear the cross for a very little hile, it gave him lasting honour. Even so the cross we carry is only or a little while at most, and then we shall receive the crown, the lory.

<p>Humiliation of soul always brings a positive blessing with it. If we mpty our hearts of self, God will fill them with his love.

Stoop if you would climb to eaven. Do we not say of Jesus, "He descended that he might ascend?" So ust you. You must grow downwards, that you may grow upwards; for the weetest fellowship with heaven is to be had by humble souls, and by hem alone. God will deny no blessing to a thoroughly humbled spirit. "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven," with all its riches and treasures. The whole exchequer of God shall be ade over by deed of gift to the soul which is humble enough to be able o receive it without growing proud because of it. God blesses us all p to the full measure and extremity of what it is safe for him to do. f you do not get a blessing, it is because it is not safe for you to ave one. If our heavenly Father were to let your unhumbled spirit win  victory in his holy war, you would pilfer the crown for yourself, and eeting with a fresh enemy you would fall a victim; so that you are ept low for your own safety. When a man is sincerely humble, and never entures to touch so much as a grain of the praise, there is scarcely ny limit to what God will do for him. Humility makes us ready to be lessed by the God of all grace, and fits us to deal efficiently with ur fellow men. True humility is a flower which will adorn any garden. his is a sauce with which you may season every dish of life, and you ill find an improvement in every case.

<div class="response">
<p>Jesus, bearing his cross, went forth to suffer without the gate. The hristian's reason for leaving the camp of the world's sin and religion s not because he loves to be singular, but because Jesus did so; and he disciple must follow his Master. Christ was "not of the world:" his ife and his testimony were a constant protest against conformity with he world. Never was such overflowing affection for men as you find in im; but still he was separate from sinners. In like manner Christ's eople must "go forth unto him." They must take their position "without he camp," as witness-bearers for the truth. They must be prepared to read the straight and narrow path. They must have bold, unflinching, ion-like hearts, loving Christ first, and his truth next, and Christ nd his truth beyond all the world. Jesus would have his people "go orth without the camp" for their own sanctification. You cannot grow n grace to any high degree while you are conformed to the world. The ife of separation may be a path of sorrow, but it is the highway of afety; and though the separated life may cost you many pangs, and make very day a battle, yet it is a happy life after all. No joy can excel hat of the soldier of Christ: Jesus reveals himself so graciously, and ives such sweet refreshment, that the warrior feels more calm and eace in his daily strife than others in their hours of rest. The ighway of holiness is the highway of communion. It is thus we shall ope to win the crown if we are enabled by divine grace faithfully to ollow Christ "without the camp." The crown of glory will follow the ross of separation. A moment's shame will be well recompensed by ternal honour; a little while of witness-bearing will seem nothing hen we are "forever with the Lord."</p>

He contemplated in his passion the anctification of us wholly, spirit, soul, and body; that in this riple kingdom he himself might reign supreme without a rival. It is he business of the newborn nature which God has given to the egenerate to assert the rights of the Lord Jesus Christ. My soul, so ar as thou art a child of God, thou must conquer all the rest of hyself which yet remains unblest; thou must subdue all thy powers and assions to the silver sceptre of Jesus' gracious reign, and thou must ever be satisfied till he who is King by purchase becomes also King by racious coronation, and reigns in thee supreme. Seeing, then, that sin as no right to any part of us, we go about a good and lawful warfare hen we seek, in the name of God, to drive it out. O my body, thou art  member of Christ: shall I tolerate thy subjection to the prince of arkness? O my soul, Christ has suffered for thy sins, and redeemed hee with his most precious blood: shall I suffer thy memory to become  storehouse of evil, or thy passions to be firebrands of iniquity? hall I surrender my judgment to be perverted by error, or my will to e led in fetters of iniquity? No, my soul, thou art Christ's, and sin ath no right to thee.</p>
<p>Be courageous concerning this, O Christian! be not dispirited, as hough your spiritual enemies could never be destroyed. You are able to vercome them--not in your own strength--the weakest of them would be oo much for you in that; but you can and shall overcome them through he blood of the Lamb. Do not ask, "How shall I dispossess them, for hey are greater and mightier than I?" but go to the strong for trength, wait humbly upon God, and the mighty God of Jacob will surely ome to the rescue, and you shall sing of victory through his grace.</p>

<p>An instructive writer has made a mournful list of the honours which the linded people of Israel awarded to their long expected King.</p>
<p>1. They gave him a procession of honour, in which Roman legionaries, ewish priests, men and women, took a part, he himself bearing his ross. This is the triumph which the world awards to him who comes to verthrow man's direst foes. Derisive shouts are his only acclamations, nd cruel taunts his only paeans of praise.</p>
<p>2. They presented him with the wine of honour. Instead of a golden cup f generous wine they offered him the criminal's stupefying eath-draught, which he refused because he would preserve an uninjured aste wherewith to taste of death; and afterwards when he cried, "I hirst," they gave him vinegar mixed with gall, thrust to his mouth pon a sponge. Oh! wretched, detestable inhospitality to the King's on.</p>
<p>3. He was provided with a guard of honour, who showed their esteem of im by gambling over his garments, which they had seized as their ooty. Such was the body-guard of the adored of heaven; a quaternion of rutal gamblers.</p>
<p>4. A throne of honour was found for him upon the bloody tree; no easier lace of rest would rebel men yield to their liege Lord. The cross was, n fact, the full expression of the world's feeling towards him; "There," they seemed to say, "thou Son of God, this is the manner in hich God himself should be treated, could we reach him."</p>
<p>5. The title of honour was nominally "King of the Jews," but that the linded nation distinctly repudiated, and really called him "King of hieves," by preferring Barabbas, and by placing Jesus in the place of ighest shame between two thieves. His glory was thus in all things urned into shame by the sons of men, but it shall yet gladden the eyes f saints and angels, world without end.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>In this solemn confession, it is pleasing to observe that David plainly ames his sin. He does not call it manslaughter, nor speak of it as an mprudence by which an unfortunate accident occurred to a worthy man, ut he calls it by its true name, bloodguiltiness. He did not actually ill the husband of Bathsheba; but still it was planned in David's eart that Uriah should be slain, and he was before the Lord his urderer. Learn in confession to be honest with God. Do not give fair ames to foul sins; call them what you will, they will smell no weeter. What God sees them to be, that do you labour to feel them to e; and with all openness of heart acknowledge their real character. bserve, that David was evidently oppressed with the heinousness of his in. It is easy to use words, but it is difficult to feel their eaning. The fifty-first Psalm is the photograph of a contrite spirit. et us seek after the like brokenness of heart; for however excellent ur words may be, if our heart is not conscious of the ell-deservingness of sin, we cannot expect to find forgiveness.</p>
<p>Our text has in it an earnest prayer--it is addressed to the God of alvation. It is his prerogative to forgive; it is his very name and ffice to save those who seek his face. Better still, the text calls im the God of my salvation. Yes, blessed be his name, while I am yet oing to him through Jesus' blood, I can rejoice in the God of my alvation.</p>
<p>The psalmist ends with a commendable vow: if God will deliver him he ill sing--nay, more, he will "sing aloud." Who can sing in any other tyle of such a mercy as this! But note the subject of the song--"Thy ighteousness." We must sing of the finished work of a precious aviour; and he who knows most of forgiving love will sing the loudest.</p>

O sinner, Jesus as led away by his enemies: so shall you be dragged away by fiends to he place appointed for you. Jesus was deserted of God; and if he, who as only imputedly a sinner, was deserted, how much more shall you be? "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" what an awful shriek!

<div class="response">
<p>The words are capable of being translated, "thy goodness hath made me reat." David gratefully ascribed all his greatness not to his own oodness, but the goodness of God. "Thy providence," is another eading; and providence is nothing more than goodness in action. oodness is the bud of which providence is the flower, or goodness is he seed of which providence is the harvest. Some render it, "thy elp," which is but another word for providence; providence being the irm ally of the saints, aiding them in the service of their Lord. Or gain, "thy humility hath made me great." "Thy condescension" may, erhaps, serve as a comprehensive reading, combining the ideas entioned, including that of humility. It is God's making himself ittle which is the cause of our being made great. We are so little, hat if God should manifest his greatness without condescension, we hould be trampled under his feet; but God, who must stoop to view the kies, and bow to see what angels do, turns his eye yet lower, and ooks to the lowly and contrite, and makes them great. There are yet ther readings, as for instance, the Septuagint, which reads, "thy iscipline"--thy fatherly correction--"hath made me great;" while the haldee paraphrase reads, "thy word hath increased me." Still the idea s the same. David ascribes all his own greatness to the condescending oodness of his Father in heaven. May this sentiment be echoed in our earts this evening while we cast our crowns at Jesus' feet, and cry, "thy gentleness hath made me great." How marvellous has been our xperience of God's gentleness! How gentle have been his corrections! ow gentle his forbearance! How gentle his teachings! How gentle his rawings! Meditate upon this theme, O believer. Let gratitude be wakened; let humility be deepened; let love be quickened ere thou allest asleep tonight.</p>

<p>"Is it not strange, the darkest hour</p>

You who have had your seasons of conflict, will confess hat it was not at Olivet that you ever found comfort, not on the hill f Sinai, nor on Tabor; but Gethsemane, Gabbatha, and Golgotha have een a means of comfort to you.

Thus Calvary yields us comfort rare and rich. e never should have known Christ's love in all its heights and depths f he had not died; nor could we guess the Father's deep affection if e had not given his Son to die. The common mercies we enjoy all sing f love, just as the sea-shell, when we put it to our ears, whispers of he deep sea whence it came; but if we desire to hear the ocean itself, e must not look at every-day blessings, but at the transactions of the rucifixion.

Burdened with his own weight, the ugust sufferer felt the strain increasing every moment of those six ong hours. His sense of faintness and general weakness were verpowering; while to his own consciousness he became nothing but a ass of misery and swooning sickness. When Daniel saw the great vision, e thus describes his sensations, "There remained no strength in me, or my vigour was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength:" how much more faint must have been our greater Prophet when he saw the read vision of the wrath of God, and felt it in his own soul!

<div class="response">
<p>It is well for us when prayers about our sorrows are linked with pleas oncerning our sins--when, being under God's hand, we are not wholly aken up with our pain, but remember our offences against God. It is ell, also, to take both sorrow and sin to the same place. It was to od that David carried his sorrow: it was to God that David confessed is sin. Observe, then, we must take our sorrows to God. Even your ittle sorrows you may roll upon God, for he counteth the hairs of your ead; and your great sorrows you may commit to him, for he holdeth the cean in the hollow of his hand. Go to him, whatever your present rouble may be, and you shall find him able and willing to relieve you. ut we must take our sins to God too. We must carry them to the cross, hat the blood may fall upon them, to purge away their guilt, and to estroy their defiling power.</p>
<p>The special lesson of the text is this:--that we are to go to the Lord ith sorrows and with sins in the right spirit. Note that all David sks concerning his sorrow is, "Look upon mine affliction and my pain;" but the next petition is vastly more express, definite, decided, lain--"Forgive all my sins." Many sufferers would have put it, "Remove y affliction and my pain, and look at my sins." But David does not say o; he cries, "Lord, as for my affliction and my pain, I will not ictate to thy wisdom. Lord, look at them, I will leave them to thee, I hould be glad to have my pain removed, but do as thou wilt; but as for y sins, Lord, I know what I want with them; I must have them forgiven;  cannot endure to lie under their curse for a moment." A Christian ounts sorrow lighter in the scale than sin; he can bear that his roubles should continue, but he cannot support the burden of his ransgressions.</p>

<p>Myrrh may well be chosen as the type of Jesus on account of its reciousness, its perfume, its pleasantness, its healing, preserving, isinfecting qualities, and its connection with sacrifice. But why is e compared to "a bundle of myrrh"? First, for plenty. He is not a drop f it, he is a casket full. He is not a sprig or flower of it, but a hole bundle. There is enough in Christ for all my necessities; let me ot be slow to avail myself of him. Our well-beloved is compared to a "bundle" again, for variety: for there is in Christ not only the one hing needful, but in "him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead odily;" everything needful is in him. Take Jesus in his different haracters, and you will see a marvellous variety--Prophet, Priest, ing, Husband, Friend, Shepherd. Consider him in his life, death, esurrection, ascension, second advent; view him in his virtue, entleness, courage, self-denial, love, faithfulness, truth, ighteousness--everywhere he is a bundle of preciousness. He is a</p>
<p>"bundle of myrrh" for preservation--not loose myrrh to be dropped on he floor or trodden on, but myrrh tied up, myrrh to be stored in a asket. We must value him as our best treasure; we must prize his words nd his ordinances; and we must keep our thoughts of him and knowledge f him as under lock and key, lest the devil should steal anything from s. Moreover, Jesus is a "bundle of myrrh" for speciality; the emblem uggests the idea of distinguishing, discriminating grace. From before he foundation of the world, he was set apart for his people; and he ives forth his perfume only to those who understand how to enter into ommunion with him, to have close dealings with him.

<p>Our Lord's being made "sin for us" is set forth here by the very ignificant transfer of sin to the bullock, which was made by the lders of the people. The laying of the hand was not a mere touch of ontact, for in some other places of Scripture the original word has he meaning of leaning heavily, as in the expression, "thy wrath lieth ard upon me" (Psalm 88:7). Surely this is the very essence and nature f faith, which doth not only bring us into contact with the great ubstitute, but teaches us to lean upon him with all the burden of our uilt. Jehovah made to meet upon the head of the Substitute all the ffences of his covenant people, but each one of the chosen is brought ersonally to ratify this solemn covenant act, when by grace he is nabled by faith to lay his hand upon the head of the "Lamb slain from efore the foundation of the world." Believer, do you remember that apturous day when you first realized pardon through Jesus the in-bearer? Can you not make glad confession, and join with the writer n saying, "My soul recalls her day of deliverance with delight. Laden ith guilt and full of fears, I saw my Saviour as my Substitute, and I aid my hand upon him; oh! how timidly at first, but courage grew and onfidence was confirmed until I leaned my soul entirely upon him; and ow it is my unceasing joy to know that my sins are no longer imputed o me, but laid on him, and like the debts of the wounded traveller, esus, like the good Samaritan, has said of all my future sinfulness, et that to my account.'" Blessed discovery! Eternal solace of a rateful heart!</p>
<p>"My numerous sins transferr'd to him,</p>
<p>Shall never more be found,</p>
<p>Lost in his blood's atoning stream,</p>
<p>Where every crime is drown'd!"</p>

At this moment physical eakness was united with acute mental torture from the shame and gnominy through which he had to pass; and to make his grief culminate ith emphasis, he suffered spiritual agony surpassing all expression, esulting from the departure of his Father's presence. This was the lack midnight of his horror; then it was that he descended the abyss f suffering. No man can enter into the full meaning of these words. ome of us think at times that we could cry, "My God, my God, why hast hou forsaken me?" There are seasons when the brightness of our ather's smile is eclipsed by clouds and darkness; but let us remember hat God never does really forsake us. It is only a seeming forsaking ith us, but in Christ's case it was a real forsaking.

David himself said, "Unto thee, O God, do I lift up y soul," and he here feels the necessity that other men's souls should e lifted up as well as his own. When you ask this blessing for ourself, forget not to seek it for others also. There are three ways n which God's people require to be lifted up. They require to be levated in character. Lift them up, O Lord; do not suffer thy people o be like the world's people! The world lieth in the wicked one; lift hem out of it! The world's people are looking after silver and gold, eeking their own pleasures, and the gratification of their lusts; but, ord, lift thy people up above all this; keep them from being "muck-rakers," as John Bunyan calls the man who was always scraping fter gold! Set thou their hearts upon their risen Lord and the eavenly heritage! Moreover, believers need to be prospered in onflict. In the battle, if they seem to fall, O Lord, be pleased to ive them the victory. If the foot of the foe be upon their necks for a oment, help them to grasp the sword of the Spirit, and eventually to in the battle. Lord, lift up thy children's spirits in the day of onflict; let them not sit in the dust, mourning forever. Suffer not he adversary to vex them sore, and make them fret; but if they have een, like Hannah, persecuted, let them sing of the mercy of a elivering God.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Standing at the foot of the cross, we see hands, and feet, and side, ll distilling crimson streams of precious blood. It is "precious" because of its redeeming and atoning efficacy. By it the sins of hrist's people are atoned for; they are redeemed from under the law; hey are reconciled to God, made one with him. Christ's blood is also "precious" in its cleansing power; it "cleanseth from all sin." "Though our sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." Through esus' blood there is not a spot left upon any believer, no wrinkle nor ny such thing remains. O precious blood, which makes us clean, emoving the stains of abundant iniquity, and permitting us to stand ccepted in the Beloved, notwithstanding the many ways in which we have ebelled against our God. The blood of Christ is likewise "precious" in ts preserving power. We are safe from the destroying angel under the prinkled blood. Remember it is God's seeing the blood which is the rue reason for our being spared. Here is comfort for us when the eye f faith is dim, for God's eye is still the same. The blood of Christ s "precious" also in its sanctifying influence. The same blood which ustifies by taking away sin, does in its after-action, quicken the new ature and lead it onward to subdue sin and to follow out the commands f God. There is no motive for holiness so great as that which streams rom the veins of Jesus. And "precious," unspeakably precious, is this lood, because it has an overcoming power. It is written, "They vercame through the blood of the Lamb." How could they do otherwise? e who fights with the precious blood of Jesus, fights with a weapon hich cannot know defeat. The blood of Jesus! sin dies at its presence, eath ceases to be death: heaven's gates are opened. The blood of esus! we shall march on, conquering and to conquer, so long as we can rust its power!</p>

The Lord cannot deny his own eclarations. Hold up the rod of promise, and have what you will.</p>
<p>Moses grew weary, and then his friends assisted him. When at any time our prayer flags, let faith support one hand, and let holy hope uplift he other, and prayer seating itself upon the stone of Israel, the rock f our salvation, will persevere and prevail.

Let us cry, then, for special trength, and may the Spirit of God, who helpeth our infirmities, as he llowed help to Moses, enable us like him to continue with our hands teady "until the going down of the sun;" till the evening of life is ver; till we shall come to the rising of a better sun in the land here prayer is swallowed up in praise.</p>

The blood of Jesus is the life of all vital odliness. If you have truly come to Jesus, we know how you came--the oly Spirit sweetly brought you there. You came to the blood of prinkling with no merits of your own. Guilty, lost, and helpless, you ame to take that blood, and that blood alone, as your everlasting ope. You came to the cross of Christ, with a trembling and an aching eart; and oh! what a precious sound it was to you to hear the voice of he blood of Jesus! The dropping of his blood is as the music of heaven o the penitent sons of earth. We are full of sin, but the Saviour bids s lift our eyes to him, and as we gaze upon his streaming wounds, each rop of blood, as it falls, cries, "It is finished; I have made an end f sin; I have brought in everlasting righteousness." Oh! sweet anguage of the precious blood of Jesus! If you have come to that blood nce, you will come to it constantly. Your life will be "Looking unto esus." Your whole conduct will be epitomized in this--"To whom oming." Not to whom I have come, but to whom I am always coming. If hou hast ever come to the blood of sprinkling, thou wilt feel thy need f coming to it every day. He who does not desire to wash in it every ay, has never washed in it at all. The believer ever feels it to be is joy and privilege that there is still a fountain opened. Past xperiences are doubtful food for Christians; a present coming to hrist alone can give us joy and comfort. This morning let us sprinkle ur door-post fresh with blood, and then feast upon the Lamb, assured hat the destroying angel must pass us by.</p>

If Jesus be a soul's desire, t is a blessed sign of divine work within. Such a man will never be ontent with mere ordinances.

When Jesus died, the acrifices were all finished, because all fulfilled in him, and herefore the place of their presentation was marked with an evident oken of decay. That rent also revealed all the hidden things of the ld dispensation: the mercy-seat could now be seen, and the glory of od gleamed forth above it. By the death of our Lord Jesus we have a lear revelation of God, for he was "not as Moses, who put a veil over is face." Life and immortality are now brought to light, and things hich have been hidden since the foundation of the world are manifest n him. The annual ceremony of atonement was thus abolished. The toning blood which was once every year sprinkled within the veil, was ow offered once for all by the great High Priest, and therefore the lace of the symbolical rite was broken up. No blood of bullocks or of ambs is needed now, for Jesus has entered within the veil with his own lood. Hence access to God is now permitted, and is the privilege of very believer in Christ Jesus. There is no small space laid open hrough which we may peer at the mercy-seat, but the rent reaches from he top to the bottom. We may come with boldness to the throne of the eavenly grace. Shall we err if we say that the opening of the Holy of olies in this marvellous manner by our Lord's expiring cry was the ype of the opening of the gates of paradise to all the saints by irtue of the Passion?

The sail is spread; the soul is launched upon the deep. How ong will be its voyage? How many wearying winds must beat upon the ail ere it shall be reefed in the port of peace? How long shall that oul be tossed upon the waves before it comes to that sea which knows o storm? Listen to the answer, "Absent from the body, present with the ord." Yon ship has just departed, but it is already at its haven. It id but spread its sail and it was there. Like that ship of old, upon he Lake of Galilee, a storm had tossed it, but Jesus said, "Peace, be till," and immediately it came to land. Think not that a long period ntervenes between the instant of death and the eternity of glory. When he eyes close on earth they open in heaven. The horses of fire are not n instant on the road. Then, O child of God, what is there for thee to ear in death, seeing that through the death of thy Lord its curse and ting are destroyed? and now it is but a Jacob's ladder whose foot is n the dark grave, but its top reaches to glory everlasting.</p>

<p>The sacramental host of God's elect is warring still on earth, Jesus hrist being the Captain of their salvation. He has said, "Lo! I am ith you alway, even unto the end of the world." Hark to the shouts of ar! Now let the people of God stand fast in their ranks, and let no an's heart fail him. It is true that just now in England the battle is urned against us, and unless the Lord Jesus shall lift his sword, we now not what may become of the church of God in this land; but let us e of good courage, and play the man. There never was a day when rotestantism seemed to tremble more in the scales than now that a ierce effort is making to restore the Romish antichrist to his ancient eat. We greatly want a bold voice and a strong hand to preach and ublish the old gospel for which martyrs bled and confessors died. The aviour is, by his Spirit, still on earth; let this cheer us. He is ver in the midst of the fight, and therefore the battle is not oubtful. And as the conflict rages, what a sweet satisfaction it is to now that the Lord Jesus, in his office as our great Intercessor, is revalently pleading for his people! O anxious gazer, look not so much t the battle below, for there thou shalt be enshrouded in smoke, and mazed with garments rolled in blood; but lift thine eyes yonder where he Saviour lives and pleads, for while he intercedes, the cause of God s safe. Let us fight as if it all depended upon us, but let us look up nd know that all depends upon him.</p>
<p>Now, by the lilies of Christian purity, and by the roses of the aviour's atonement, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, we harge you who are lovers of Jesus, to do valiantly in the Holy War, or truth and righteousness, for the kingdom and crown jewels of your aster. Onward! "for the battle is not yours but God's."</p>

<p>The marrow of Job's comfort lies in that little word "My"--"My edeemer," and in the fact that the Redeemer lives. Oh! to get hold of  living Christ. We must get a property in him before we can enjoy him. hat is gold in the mine to me? Men are beggars in Peru, and beg their read in California. It is gold in my purse which will satisfy my ecessities, by purchasing the bread I need. So a Redeemer who does not edeem me, an avenger who will never stand up for my blood, of what vail were such? Rest not content until by faith you can say "Yes, I ast myself upon my living Lord; and he is mine." It may be you hold im with a feeble hand; you half think it presumption to say, "He lives s my Redeemer;" yet, remember if you have but faith as a grain of ustard seed, that little faith entitles you to say it. But there is lso another word here, expressive of Job's strong confidence, "I now." To say, "I hope so, I trust so" is comfortable; and there are housands in the fold of Jesus who hardly ever get much further. But to each the essence of consolation you must say, "I know." Ifs, buts, and erhapses, are sure murderers of peace and comfort. Doubts are dreary hings in times of sorrow. Like wasps they sting the soul! If I have ny suspicion that Christ is not mine, then there is vinegar mingled ith the gall of death; but if I know that Jesus lives for me, then arkness is not dark: even the night is light about me. Surely if Job, n those ages before the coming and advent of Christ, could say, "I now," we should not speak less positively. God forbid that our ositiveness should be presumption. Let us see that our evidences are ight, lest we build upon an ungrounded hope; and then let us not be atisfied with the mere foundation, for it is from the upper rooms that e get the widest prospect.

<p>Jesus, our Lord, once crucified, dead and buried, now sits upon the hrone of glory. The highest place that heaven affords is his by ndisputed right. It is sweet to remember that the exaltation of Christ n heaven is a representative exaltation. He is exalted at the Father's ight hand, and though as Jehovah he had eminent glories, in which inite creatures cannot share, yet as the Mediator, the honours which esus wears in heaven are the heritage of all the saints. It is elightful to reflect how close is Christ's union with his people. We re actually one with him; we are members of his body; and his xaltation is our exaltation. He will give us to sit upon his throne, ven as he has overcome, and is set down with his Father on his throne; e has a crown, and he gives us crowns too; he has a throne, but he is ot content with having a throne to himself, on his right hand there ust be his queen, arrayed in "gold of Ophir." He cannot be glorified ithout his bride. Look up, believer, to Jesus now; let the eye of your aith behold him with many crowns upon his head; and remember that you ill one day be like him, when you shall see him as he is; you shall ot be so great as he is, you shall not be so divine, but still you hall, in a measure, share the same honours, and enjoy the same appiness and the same dignity which he possesses. Be content to live nknown for a little while, and to walk your weary way through the ields of poverty, or up the hills of affliction; for by-and-by you hall reign with Christ, for he has "made us kings and priests unto od, and we shall reign forever and ever."

<p>What is this terror? It may be the cry of fire, or the noise of hieves, or fancied appearances, or the shriek of sudden sickness or eath. We live in the world of death and sorrow, we may therefore look or ills as well in the night-watches as beneath the glare of the roiling sun. Nor should this alarm us, for be the terror what it may, he promise is that the believer shall not be afraid. Why should he? et us put it more closely, why should we? God our Father is here, and ill be here all through the lonely hours; he is an almighty Watcher, a leepless Guardian, a faithful Friend. Nothing can happen without his irection, for even hell itself is under his control. Darkness is not ark to him. He has promised to be a wall of fire around his eople--and who can break through such a barrier? Worldlings may well e afraid, for they have an angry God above them, a guilty conscience ithin them, and a yawning hell beneath them; but we who rest in Jesus re saved from all these through rich mercy. If we give way to foolish ear we shall dishonour our profession, and lead others to doubt the eality of godliness. We ought to be afraid of being afraid, lest we hould vex the Holy Spirit by foolish distrust. Down, then, ye dismal orebodings and groundless apprehensions, God has not forgotten to be racious, nor shut up his tender mercies; it may be night in the soul, ut there need be no terror, for the God of love changes not. Children f light may walk in darkness, but they are not therefore cast away, ay, they are now enabled to prove their adoption by trusting in their eavenly Father as hypocrites cannot do.</p>

Take your sins to hrist's cross, for the old man can only be crucified there: we are rucified with him. The only weapon to fight sin with is the spear hich pierced the side of Jesus. To give an illustration--you want to vercome an angry temper; how do you go to work? It is very possible ou have never tried the right way of going to Jesus with it. How did I et salvation? I came to Jesus just as I was, and I trusted him to save e. I must kill my angry temper in the same way. It is the only way in hich I can ever kill it.

Tell him, "Lord,  have trusted thee, and thy name is Jesus, for thou dost save thy eople from their sins: Lord, this is one of my sins; save me from it!" Ordinances are nothing without Christ as a means of mortification. Your rayers, and your repentances, and your tears--the whole of them put ogether--are worth nothing apart from him.

The thorny crown is more than an imperial iadem. It is true that he bears not now the sceptre of reed, but there as a glory in it that never flashed from sceptre of gold.

Can it be possible? es, it is not only possible, but conscience confesses that it is too adly a fault with all of us, that we suffer him to be as a wayfaring an tarrying but for a night. He whom we should make the abiding tenant f our memories is but a visitor therein.

<p>It is strange how little use we make of the spiritual blessings which od gives us, but it is stranger still how little use we make of God imself. Though he is "our own God," we apply ourselves but little to im, and ask but little of him. How seldom do we ask counsel at the ands of the Lord! How often do we go about our business, without eeking his guidance! In our troubles how constantly do we strive to ear our burdens ourselves, instead of casting them upon the Lord, that e may sustain us! This is not because we may not, for the Lord seems o say, "I am thine, soul, come and make use of me as thou wilt; thou ayst freely come to my store, and the oftener the more welcome." It is ur own fault if we make not free with the riches of our God. Then, ince thou hast such a friend, and he invites thee, draw from him aily. Never want whilst thou hast a God to go to; never fear or faint hilst thou hast God to help thee; go to thy treasure and take whatever hou needest--there is all that thou canst want. Learn the divine skill f making God all things to thee. He can supply thee with all, or, etter still, he can be to thee instead of all. Let me urge thee, then, o make use of thy God. Make use of him in prayer. Go to him often, ecause he is thy God. O, wilt thou fail to use so great a privilege? ly to him, tell him all thy wants. Use him constantly by faith at all imes. If some dark providence has beclouded thee, use thy God as a "sun;" if some strong enemy has beset thee, find in Jehovah a "shield," for he is a sun and shield to his people. If thou hast lost thy way in he mazes of life, use him as a "guide," for he will direct thee. hatever thou art, and wherever thou art, remember God is just what hou wantest, and just where thou wantest, and that he can do all thou antest.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is no despotic claimant of divine right, but he is really nd truly the Lord's anointed! "It hath pleased the Father that in him hould all fulness dwell." God hath given to him all power and all uthority. As the Son of man, he is now head over all things to his hurch, and he reigns over heaven, and earth, and hell, with the keys f life and death at his girdle. Certain princes have delighted to call hemselves kings by the popular will, and certainly our Lord Jesus hrist is such in his church. If it could be put to the vote whether he hould be King in the church, every believing heart would crown him. O hat we could crown him more gloriously than we do! We would count no xpense to be wasted that could glorify Christ. Suffering would be leasure, and loss would be gain, if thereby we could surround his brow ith brighter crowns, and make him more glorious in the eyes of men and ngels. Yes, he shall reign. Long live the King! All hail to thee, King esus! Go forth, ye virgin souls who love your Lord, bow at his feet, trew his way with the lilies of your love, and the roses of your ratitude: "Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him Lord of all." Moreover, our Lord Jesus is King in Zion by right of conquest: he has aken and carried by storm the hearts of his people, and has slain heir enemies who held them in cruel bondage. In the Red Sea of his own lood, our Redeemer has drowned the Pharaoh of our sins: shall he not e King in Jeshurun? He has delivered us from the iron yoke and heavy urse of the law: shall not the Liberator be crowned? We are his ortion, whom he has taken out of the hand of the Amorite with his word and with his bow: who shall snatch his conquest from his hand? ll hail, King Jesus! we gladly own thy gentle sway!

<p>Are there no exceptions? No, not one. Even the favoured race are thus escribed. Are the best so bad?--then what must the worst be? Come, my eart, consider how far thou hast a share in this universal accusation, nd while considering, be ready to take shame unto thyself wherein thou ayst have been guilty. The first charge is impudence, or hardness of orehead, a want of holy shame, an unhallowed boldness in evil. Before y conversion, I could sin and feel no compunction, hear of my guilt nd yet remain unhumbled, and even confess my iniquity and manifest no nward humiliation on account of it. For a sinner to go to God's house nd pretend to pray to him and praise him argues a brazen-facedness of he worst kind! Alas! since the day of my new birth I have doubted my ord to his face, murmured unblushingly in his presence, worshipped efore him in a slovenly manner, and sinned without bewailing myself oncerning it. If my forehead were not as an adamant, harder than lint, I should have far more holy fear, and a far deeper contrition of pirit. Woe is me, I am one of the impudent house of Israel. The second harge is hardheartedness, and I must not venture to plead innocent ere. Once I had nothing but a heart of stone, and although through race I now have a new and fleshy heart, much of my former obduracy emains. I am not affected by the death of Jesus as I ought to be; either am I moved by the ruin of my fellow men, the wickedness of the imes, the chastisement of my heavenly Father, and my own failures, as  should be. O that my heart would melt at the recital of my Saviour's ufferings and death. Would to God I were rid of this nether millstone ithin me, this hateful body of death. Blessed be the name of the Lord, he disease is not incurable, the Saviour's precious blood is the niversal solvent, and me, even me, it will effectually soften, till my eart melts as wax before the fire.</p>

<p>The path of the Christian is not always bright with sunshine; he has is seasons of darkness and of storm.

At ertain periods clouds cover the believer's sun, and he walks in arkness and sees no light. There are many who have rejoiced in the resence of God for a season; they have basked in the sunshine in the arlier stages of their Christian career; they have walked along the "green pastures" by the side of the "still waters," but suddenly they ind the glorious sky is clouded; instead of the Land of Goshen they ave to tread the sandy desert; in the place of sweet waters, they find roubled streams, bitter to their taste, and they say, "Surely, if I ere a child of God, this would not happen." Oh! say not so, thou who rt walking in darkness. The best of God's saints must drink the ormwood; the dearest of his children must bear the cross. No Christian as enjoyed perpetual prosperity; no believer can always keep his harp rom the willows. Perhaps the Lord allotted you at first a smooth and nclouded path, because you were weak and timid. He tempered the wind o the shorn lamb, but now that you are stronger in the spiritual life, ou must enter upon the riper and rougher experience of God's ull-grown children. We need winds and tempests to exercise our faith, o tear off the rotten bough of self-dependence, and to root us more irmly in Christ. The day of evil reveals to us the value of our lorious hope.</p>

His houghts are always tender, loving, wise, prudent, far-reaching, and hey bring to us countless benefits: hence it is a choice delight to emember them. The Lord always did think upon his people: hence their lection and the covenant of grace by which their salvation is secured; e always will think upon them: hence their final perseverance by which hey shall be brought safely to their final rest. In all our wanderings he watchful glance of the Eternal Watcher is evermore fixed upon s--we never roam beyond the Shepherd's eye. In our sorrows he observes s incessantly, and not a pang escapes him; in our toils he marks all ur weariness, and writes in his book all the struggles of his faithful nes.

Yet how requently does the wearied pilgrim put up the prayer, "O that I had ings like a dove! for then would I fly away and be at rest;" but hrist does not pray like that, he leaves us in his Father's hands, ntil, like shocks of corn fully ripe, we shall each be gathered into ur Master's garner. Jesus does not plead for our instant removal by eath, for to abide in the flesh is needful for others if not rofitable for ourselves. He asks that we may be kept from evil, but he ever asks for us to be admitted to the inheritance in glory till we re of full age. Christians often want to die when they have any rouble. Ask them why, and they tell you, "Because we would be with the ord."

They want to go home, not so much for the Saviour's ompany, as to be at rest.

Rather let your care and wish be to glorify God by your life here s long as he pleases, even though it be in the midst of toil, and onflict, and suffering, and leave him to say when "it is enough."</p>

<p>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods.</p>

<p>One great besetting sin of ancient Israel was idolatry, and the piritual Israel are vexed with a tendency to the same folly. Remphan's tar shines no longer, and the women weep no more for Tammuz, but ammon still intrudes his golden calf, and the shrines of pride are not orsaken. Self in various forms struggles to subdue the chosen ones nder its dominion, and the flesh sets up its altars wherever it can ind space for them. Favourite children are often the cause of much sin n believers; the Lord is grieved when he sees us doting upon them bove measure; they will live to be as great a curse to us as Absalom as to David, or they will be taken from us to leave our homes esolate. If Christians desire to grow thorns to stuff their sleepless illows, let them dote on their dear ones.</p>
<p>It is truly said that "they are no gods," for the objects of our oolish love are very doubtful blessings, the solace which they yield s now is dangerous, and the help which they can give us in the hour of rouble is little indeed. Why, then, are we so bewitched with vanities? e pity the poor heathen who adore a god of stone, and yet worship a od of gold. Where is the vast superiority between a god of flesh and ne of wood? The principle, the sin, the folly is the same in either ase, only that in ours the crime is more aggravated because we have ore light, and sin in the face of it. The heathen bows to a false eity, but the true God he has never known; we commit two evils, nasmuch as we forsake the living God and turn unto idols. May the Lord urge us all from this grievous iniquity!</p>
<p>"The dearest idol I have known,</p>
<p>Whate'er that idol be;</p>
<p>Help me to tear it from thy throne,</p>
<p>And worship only thee."</p>

<p>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible.</p>

<p>Peter most earnestly exhorted the scattered saints to love each other "with a pure heart fervently" and he wisely fetched his argument, not rom the law, from nature, or from philosophy, but from that high and ivine nature which God hath implanted in his people. Just as some udicious tutor of princes might labour to beget and foster in them a ingly spirit and dignified behaviour, finding arguments in their osition and descent, so, looking upon God's people as heirs of glory, rinces of the blood royal, descendants of the King of kings, earth's ruest and oldest aristocracy, Peter saith to them, "See that ye love ne another, because of your noble birth, being born of incorruptible eed; because of your pedigree, being descended from God, the Creator f all things; and because of your immortal destiny, for you shall ever pass away, though the glory of the flesh shall fade, and even its xistence shall cease." It would be well if, in the spirit of humility, e recognized the true dignity of our regenerated nature, and lived up o it. What is a Christian? If you compare him with a king, he adds riestly sanctity to royal dignity. The king's royalty often lieth only n his crown, but with a Christian it is infused into his inmost ature. He is as much above his fellows through his new birth, as a man s above the beast that perisheth. Surely he ought to carry himself, in ll his dealings, as one who is not of the multitude, but chosen out of he world, distinguished by sovereign grace, written among "the eculiar people" and who therefore cannot grovel in the dust as others, or live after the manner of the world's citizens. Let the dignity of our nature, and the brightness of your prospects, O believers in hrist, constrain you to cleave unto holiness, and to avoid the very ppearance of evil.</p>

<p>What a sweet title: "My people!" What a cheering revelation: "Their od!" How much of meaning is couched in those two words, "My people!" Here is speciality. The whole world is God's; the heaven, even the eaven of heavens is the Lord's, and he reigneth among the children of en; but of those whom he hath chosen, whom he hath purchased to imself, he saith what he saith not of others--"My people." In this ord there is the idea of proprietorship. In a special manner the "Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance." All the nations upon earth are his; the whole world is in his power; et are his people, his chosen, more especially his possession; for he as done more for them than others; he has bought them with his blood; e has brought them nigh to himself; he has set his great heart upon hem; he has loved them with an everlasting love, a love which many aters cannot quench, and which the revolutions of time shall never uffice in the least degree to diminish. Dear friends, can you, by aith, see yourselves in that number? Can you look up to heaven and ay, "My Lord and my God: mine by that sweet relationship which ntitles me to call thee Father; mine by that hallowed fellowship which  delight to hold with thee when thou art pleased to manifest thyself nto me as thou dost not unto the world?" Canst thou read the Book of nspiration, and find there the indentures of thy salvation? Canst thou ead thy title writ in precious blood? Canst thou, by humble faith, lay old of Jesus' garments, and say, "My Christ"? If thou canst, then God aith of thee, and of others like thee, "My people;" for, if God be our God, and Christ your Christ, the Lord has a special, peculiar avour to you; you are the object of his choice, accepted in his eloved Son.</p>

<p>Like many others, the impotent man had been waiting for a wonder to be rought, and a sign to be given.

Many are in the same plight: they are aiting for some singular emotion, remarkable impression, or celestial ision; they wait in vain and watch for nought. Even supposing that, in  few cases, remarkable signs are seen, yet these are rare, and no man as a right to look for them in his own case; no man especially who eels his impotency to avail himself of the moving of the water even if t came. It is a very sad reflection that tens of thousands are now aiting in the use of means, and ordinances, and vows, and resolutions, nd have so waited time out of mind, in vain, utterly in vain. eanwhile these poor souls forget the present Saviour, who bids them ook unto him and be saved. He could heal them at once, but they prefer o wait for an angel and a wonder. To trust him is the sure way to very blessing, and he is worthy of the most implicit confidence; but nbelief makes them prefer the cold porches of Bethesda to the warm osom of his love. O that the Lord may turn his eye upon the multitudes ho are in this case tonight; may he forgive the slights which they put pon his divine power, and call them by that sweet constraining voice, o rise from the bed of despair, and in the energy of faith take up heir bed and walk.

<p>Years are short to the happy and healthy; but thirty-eight years of isease must have dragged a very weary length along the life of the oor impotent man. When Jesus, therefore, healed him by a word, while e lay at the pool of Bethesda, he was delightfully sensible of a hange. Even so the sinner who has for weeks and months been paralysed ith despair, and has wearily sighed for salvation, is very conscious f the change when the Lord Jesus speaks the word of power, and gives oy and peace in believing. The evil removed is too great to be removed ithout our discerning it; the life imparted is too remarkable to be ossessed and remain inoperative; and the change wrought is too arvellous not to be perceived. Yet the poor man was ignorant of the uthor of his cure; he knew not the sacredness of his person, the ffices which he sustained, or the errand which brought him among men. uch ignorance of Jesus may remain in hearts which yet feel the power f his blood. We must not hastily condemn men for lack of knowledge; ut where we can see the faith which saves the soul, we must believe hat salvation has been bestowed. The Holy Spirit makes men penitents ong before he makes them divines; and he who believes what he knows, hall soon know more clearly what he believes. Ignorance is, however, n evil; for this poor man was much tantalized by the Pharisees, and as quite unable to cope with them. It is good to be able to answer ainsayers; but we cannot do so if we know not the Lord Jesus clearly nd with understanding. The cure of his ignorance, however, soon ollowed the cure of his infirmity, for he was visited by the Lord in he temple; and after that gracious manifestation, he was found estifying that "it was Jesus who had made him whole." Lord, if thou ast saved me, show me thyself, that I may declare thee to the sons of en.</p>

Doubtless it is very easy to ritter away our inward life in outward exercises, and come to complain ith the spouse, "They made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own ineyard have I not kept;" but there is no reason why this should be he case except our own folly and neglect. Certain is it that a rofessor may do nothing, and yet grow quite as lifeless in spiritual hings as those who are most busy. Mary was not praised for sitting till; but for her sitting at Jesus' feet. Even so, Christians are not o be praised for neglecting duties under the pretence of having secret ellowship with Jesus: it is not sitting, but sitting at Jesus' feet hich is commendable. Do not think that activity is in itself an evil: t is a great blessing, and a means of grace to us.

<div class="response">
<p>The whole system of Christianity rests upon the fact that "Christ is isen from the dead;" for, "If Christ be not risen, then is our reaching vain, and your faith is also vain: ye are yet in your sins." The divinity of Christ finds its surest proof in his resurrection, ince he was "Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to he spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." It would ot be unreasonable to doubt his deity if he had not risen. Moreover, hrist's sovereignty depends upon his resurrection, "For to this end hrist both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of he dead and living." Again, our justification, that choice blessing of he covenant, is linked with Christ's triumphant victory over death and he grave; for "He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again or our justification." Nay, more, our very regeneration is connected ith his resurrection, for we are "Begotten again unto a lively hope by he resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." And most certainly our ltimate resurrection rests here, for, "If the Spirit of him that aised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ rom the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that welleth in you." If Christ be not risen, then shall we not rise; but f he be risen then they who are asleep in Christ have not perished, ut in their flesh shall surely behold their God. Thus, the silver hread of resurrection runs through all the believer's blessings, from is regeneration onwards to his eternal glory, and binds them together. ow important then will this glorious fact be in his estimation, and ow will he rejoice that beyond a doubt it is established, that "now is hrist risen from the dead"!</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Our God's tender love for his servants makes him concerned for the tate of their inward feelings. He desires them to be of good courage. ome esteem it a small thing for a believer to be vexed with doubts and ears, but God thinks not so. From this text it is plain that our aster would not have us entangled with fears. He would have us without arefulness, without doubt, without cowardice. Our Master does not hink so lightly of our unbelief as we do. When we are desponding we re subject to a grievous malady, not to be trifled with, but to be arried at once to the beloved Physician. Our Lord loveth not to see ur countenance sad. It was a law of Ahasuerus that no one should come nto the king's court dressed in mourning: this is not the law of the ing of kings, for we may come mourning as we are; but still he would ave us put off the spirit of heaviness, and put on the garment of raise, for there is much reason to rejoice. The Christian man ought to e of a courageous spirit, in order that he may glorify the Lord by nduring trials in an heroic manner. If he be fearful and fainthearted, t will dishonour his God. Besides, what a bad example it is. This isease of doubtfulness and discouragement is an epidemic which soon preads amongst the Lord's flock. One downcast believer makes twenty ouls sad. Moreover, unless your courage is kept up, Satan will be too uch for you. Let your spirit be joyful in God your Saviour, the joy of he Lord shall be your strength, and no fiend of hell shall make eadway against you; but cowardice throws down the banner. Moreover, abour is light to a man of cheerful spirit; and success waits upon heerfulness. The man who toils, rejoicing in his God, believing with ll his heart, has success guaranteed. He who sows in hope shall reap n joy; therefore, dear reader, "be thou strong, and very courageous."</p>

<div class="response">
<p>The Lord Jesus gives special revelations of himself to his people. Even f Scripture did not declare this, there are many of the children of od who could testify the truth of it from their own experience. They ave had manifestations of their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in a eculiar manner, such as no mere reading or hearing could afford. In he biographies of eminent saints, you will find many instances ecorded in which Jesus has been pleased, in a very special manner to peak to their souls, and to unfold the wonders of his person; yea, so ave their souls been steeped in happiness that they have thought hemselves to be in heaven, whereas they were not there, though they ere well nigh on the threshold of it--for when Jesus manifests himself o his people, it is heaven on earth; it is paradise in embryo; it is liss begun. Especial manifestations of Christ exercise a holy nfluence on the believer's heart. One effect will be humility. If a an says, "I have had such-and-such spiritual communications, I am a reat man," he has never had any communion with Jesus at all; for "God ath respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off." He oes not need to come near them to know them, and will never give them ny visits of love. Another effect will be happiness; for in God's resence there are pleasures for evermore. Holiness will be sure to ollow. A man who has no holiness has never had this manifestation. ome men profess a great deal; but we must not believe any one unless e see that his deeds answer to what he says. "Be not deceived; God is ot mocked." He will not bestow his favours upon the wicked: for while e will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he respect an evil oer. Thus there will be three effects of nearness to Jesus--humility, appiness, and holiness. May God give them to thee, Christian!</p>

The golden streets of paradise, the early gates, the river of life, the transcendent bliss, and the nutterable glory, are, by our blessed Lord, made over to us for our verlasting possession. All that he has he shares with his people. The rown royal he has placed upon the head of his Church, appointing her a ingdom, and calling her sons a royal priesthood, a generation of riests and kings. He uncrowned himself that we might have a coronation f glory; he would not sit upon his own throne until he had procured a lace upon it for all who overcome by his blood. Crown the head and the hole body shares the honour. Behold here the reward of every Christian onqueror! Christ's throne, crown, sceptre, palace, treasure, robes, eritage, are yours. Far superior to the jealousy, selfishness, and reed, which admit of no participation of their advantages, Christ eems his happiness completed by his people sharing it. "The glory hich thou gavest me have I given them." "These things have I spoken nto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be ull." The smiles of his Father are all the sweeter to him, because his eople share them. The honours of his kingdom are more pleasing, ecause his people appear with him in glory. More valuable to him are is conquests, since they have taught his people to overcome. He elights in his throne, because on it there is a place for them. He ejoices in his royal robes, since over them his skirts are spread. He elights the more in his joy, because he calls them to enter into it.</p>

The thief upon the cross was justified the moment hat he turned the eye of faith to Jesus; and Paul, the aged, after ears of service, was not more justified than was the thief with no ervice at all. We are today accepted in the Beloved, today absolved rom sin, today acquitted at the bar of God. Oh! soul-transporting hought!

But the Lord calls us not only his servants, but his chosen ones--"I ave chosen thee." We have not chosen him first, but he hath chosen us. f we be God's servants, we were not always so; to sovereign grace the hange must be ascribed. The eye of sovereignty singled us out, and the oice of unchanging grace declared, "I have loved thee with an verlasting love." Long ere time began or space was created God had ritten upon his heart the names of his elect people, had predestinated hem to be conformed unto the image of his Son, and ordained them heirs f all the fulness of his love, his grace, and his glory. What comfort s here! Has the Lord loved us so long, and will he yet cast us away? e knew how stiffnecked we should be; he understood that our hearts ere evil, and yet he made the choice. Ah! our Saviour is no fickle over. He doth not feel enchanted for awhile with some gleams of beauty rom his church's eye, and then afterwards cast her off because of her nfaithfulness. Nay, he married her in old eternity; and it is written f Jehovah, "He hateth putting away." The eternal choice is a bond upon ur gratitude and upon his faithfulness which neither can disown.</p>

How vast his grace, how firm his faithfulness, ow unswerving his immutability, how infinite his power, how limitless is knowledge! All these are by the Lord Jesus made the pillars of the emple of salvation; and all, without diminution of their infinity, are ovenanted to us as our perpetual inheritance.

<p>Upstarts frequently usurp the highest places, while the truly great ine in obscurity. This is a riddle in providence whose solution will ne day gladden the hearts of the upright; but it is so common a fact, hat none of us should murmur if it should fall to our own lot. When ur Lord was upon earth, although he is the Prince of the kings of the arth, yet he walked the footpath of weariness and service as the ervant of servants: what wonder is it if his followers, who are rinces of the blood, should also be looked down upon as inferior and ontemptible persons? The world is upside down, and therefore, the irst are last and the last first. See how the servile sons of Satan ord it in the earth! What a high horse they ride! How they lift up heir horn on high! Haman is in the court, while Mordecai sits in the ate; David wanders on the mountains, while Saul reigns in state; lijah is complaining in the cave while Jezebel is boasting in the alace; yet who would wish to take the places of the proud rebels? and ho, on the other hand, might not envy the despised saints? When the heel turns, those who are lowest rise, and the highest sink. Patience, hen, believer, eternity will right the wrongs of time.</p>
<p>Let us not fall into the error of letting our passions and carnal ppetites ride in triumph, while our nobler powers walk in the dust. race must reign as a prince, and make the members of the body nstruments of righteousness. The Holy Spirit loves order, and he herefore sets our powers and faculties in due rank and place, giving he highest room to those spiritual faculties which link us with the reat King; let us not disturb the divine arrangement, but ask for race that we may keep under our body and bring it into subjection. We ere not new created to allow our passions to rule over us, but that e, as kings, may reign in Christ Jesus over the triple kingdom of pirit, soul, and body, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable thing that the man who was never to die, for whom od had ordained an infinitely better lot, the man who should be arried to heaven in a chariot of fire, and be translated, that he hould not see death--should thus pray, "Let me die, I am no better han my fathers." We have here a memorable proof that God does not lways answer prayer in kind, though he always does in effect. He gave lias something better than that which he asked for, and thus really eard and answered him. Strange was it that the lion-hearted Elijah hould be so depressed by Jezebel's threat as to ask to die, and lessedly kind was it on the part of our heavenly Father that he did ot take his desponding servant at his word. There is a limit to the octrine of the prayer of faith. We are not to expect that God will ive us everything we choose to ask for. We know that we sometimes ask, nd do not receive, because we ask amiss. If we ask for that which is ot promised--if we run counter to the spirit which the Lord would have s cultivate--if we ask contrary to his will, or to the decrees of his rovidence--if we ask merely for the gratification of our own ease, and ithout an eye to his glory, we must not expect that we shall receive. et, when we ask in faith, nothing doubting, if we receive not the recise thing asked for, we shall receive an equivalent, and more than n equivalent, for it. As one remarks, "If the Lord does not pay in ilver, he will in gold; and if he does not pay in gold, he will in iamonds." If he does not give you precisely what you ask for, he will ive you that which is tantamount to it, and that which you will reatly rejoice to receive in lieu thereof. Be then, dear reader, much n prayer, and make this evening a season of earnest intercession, but ake heed what you ask.</p>

Our meagre faith brings leanness into our souls; we do ot open our mouths wide, though God has promised to fill them. Does he ot this evening draw us to trust him?

I am worthy of thy fullest onfidence, cast thy cares on me. Shake thyself from the dust of thy ares, and put on thy beautiful garments of joy." But, alas! though alled with tones of love to the blessed exercise of this comforting race, we will not come. At another time he draws us to closer ommunion with himself. We have been sitting on the doorstep of God's ouse, and he bids us advance into the banqueting hall and sup with im, but we decline the honour. There are secret rooms not yet opened o us; Jesus invites us to enter them, but we hold back. Shame on our old hearts! We are but poor lovers of our sweet Lord Jesus, not fit to e his servants, much less to be his brides, and yet he hath exalted us o be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, married to him by a lorious marriage-covenant. Herein is love! But it is love which takes o denial. If we obey not the gentle drawings of his love, he will send ffliction to drive us into closer intimacy with himself. Have us earer he will.

We ust not rest without a desperate struggle to clasp the Saviour in the rms of faith, and say, "I know whom I have believed, and I am ersuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto im."

Remember, Christian, ow cold thy prayers have been. When in thy closet thou shouldst have restled as Jacob did; but instead thereof, thy petitions have been aint and few--far removed from that humble, believing, persevering aith, which cries, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me." Yet, onderful to say, God has heard these cold prayers of thine, and not nly heard, but answered them.

What ort of conversation is this? In the first place, the gospel is very imple. So Christians should be simple and plain in their habits.

The gospel is re-eminently true, it is gold without dross; and the Christian's life ill be lustreless and valueless without the jewel of truth. The gospel s a very fearless gospel, it boldly proclaims the truth, whether men ike it or not: we must be equally faithful and unflinching. But the ospel is also very gentle. Mark this spirit in its Founder: "a bruised eed he will not break." Some professors are sharper than a horn-hedge; such men are not like Jesus. Let us seek to win others by he gentleness of our words and acts. The gospel is very loving. It is he message of the God of love to a lost and fallen race. Christ's last ommand to his disciples was, "Love one another." O for more real, earty union and love to all the saints; for more tender compassion owards the souls of the worst and vilest of men! We must not forget hat the gospel of Christ is holy. It never excuses sin: it pardons it, ut only through an atonement. If our life is to resemble the gospel, e must shun, not merely the grosser vices, but everything that would inder our perfect conformity to Christ. For his sake, for our own akes, and for the sakes of others, we must strive day by day to let ur conversation be more in accordance with his gospel.</p>

<p>Care, even though exercised upon legitimate objects, if carried to xcess, has in it the nature of sin. The precept to avoid anxious care s earnestly inculcated by our Saviour, again and again; it is eiterated by the apostles; and it is one which cannot be neglected ithout involving transgression: for the very essence of anxious care s the imagining that we are wiser than God, and the thrusting urselves into his place to do for him that which he has undertaken to o for us. We attempt to think of that which we fancy he will forget; e labour to take upon ourselves our weary burden, as if he were unable r unwilling to take it for us. Now this disobedience to his plain recept, this unbelief in his Word, this presumption in intruding upon is province, is all sinful. Yet more than this, anxious care often eads to acts of sin. He who cannot calmly leave his affairs in God's and, but will carry his own burden, is very likely to be tempted to se wrong means to help himself. This sin leads to a forsaking of God s our counsellor, and resorting instead to human wisdom. This is going o the "broken cistern" instead of to the "fountain;" a sin which was aid against Israel of old. Anxiety makes us doubt God's ovingkindness, and thus our love to him grows cold; we feel mistrust, nd thus grieve the Spirit of God, so that our prayers become hindered, ur consistent example marred, and our life one of self-seeking. Thus ant of confidence in God leads us to wander far from him; but if hrough simple faith in his promise, we cast each burden as it comes pon him, and are "careful for nothing" because he undertakes to care or us, it will keep us close to him, and strengthen us against much emptation. "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed n thee, because he trusteth in thee."</p>

<p>Mephibosheth was no great ornament to a royal table, yet he had a ontinual place at David's board, because the king could see in his ace the features of the beloved Jonathan. Like Mephibosheth, we may ry unto the King of Glory, "What is thy servant, that thou shouldst ook upon such a dead dog as I am?" but still the Lord indulges us with ost familiar intercourse with himself, because he sees in our ountenances the remembrance of his dearly-beloved Jesus. The Lord's eople are dear for another's sake. Such is the love which the Father ears to his only begotten, that for his sake he raises his lowly rethren from poverty and banishment, to courtly companionship, noble ank, and royal provision. Their deformity shall not rob them of their rivileges. Lameness is no bar to sonship; the cripple is as much the eir as if he could run like Asahel. Our right does not limp, though ur might may. A king's table is a noble hiding-place for lame legs, nd at the gospel feast we learn to glory in infirmities, because the ower of Christ resteth upon us. Yet grievous disability may mar the ersons of the best-loved saints. Here is one feasted by David, and yet o lame in both his feet that he could not go up with the king when he led from the city, and was therefore maligned and injured by his ervant Ziba. Saints whose faith is weak, and whose knowledge is lender, are great losers; they are exposed to many enemies, and cannot ollow the king whithersoever he goeth. This disease frequently arises rom falls. Bad nursing in their spiritual infancy often causes onverts to fall into a despondency from which they never recover, and in in other cases brings broken bones. Lord, help the lame to leap ike an hart, and satisfy all thy people with the bread of thy table!</p>

<p>If Mephibosheth was thus humbled by David's kindness, what shall we be n the presence of our gracious Lord? The more grace we have, the less e shall think of ourselves, for grace, like light, reveals our mpurity. Eminent saints have scarcely known to what to compare hemselves, their sense of unworthiness has been so clear and keen. "I m," says holy Rutherford, "a dry and withered branch, a piece of dead arcass, dry bones, and not able to step over a straw." In another lace he writes, "Except as to open outbreakings, I want nothing of hat Judas and Cain had." The meanest objects in nature appear to the umbled mind to have a preference above itself, because they have never ontracted sin: a dog may be greedy, fierce, or filthy, but it has no onscience to violate, no Holy Spirit to resist. A dog may be a orthless animal, and yet by a little kindness it is soon won to love ts master, and is faithful unto death; but we forget the goodness of he Lord, and follow not at his call. The term "dead dog" is the most xpressive of all terms of contempt, but it is none too strong to xpress the self- abhorrence of instructed believers. They do not ffect mock modesty, they mean what they say, they have weighed hemselves in the balances of the sanctuary, and found out the vanity f their nature. At best, we are but clay, animated dust, mere walking illocks; but viewed as sinners, we are monsters indeed. Let it be ublished in heaven as a wonder, that the Lord Jesus should set his eart's love upon such as we are. Dust and ashes though we be, we must nd will "magnify the exceeding greatness of his grace." Could not his eart find rest in heaven? Must he needs come to these tents of Kedar or a spouse, and choose a bride upon whom the sun had looked? O eavens and earth, break forth into a song, and give all glory to our weet Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>Memory is frequently the bond slave of despondency. Dispairing minds all to remembrance every dark foreboding in the past, and dilate upon very gloomy feature in the present; thus memory, clothed in sackcloth, resents to the mind a cup of mingled gall and wormwood. There is, owever, no necessity for this. Wisdom can readily transform memory nto an angel of comfort. That same recollection which in its left hand rings so many gloomy omens, may be trained to bear in its right a ealth of hopeful signs. She need not wear a crown of iron, she may ncircle her brow with a fillet of gold, all spangled with stars. Thus t was in Jeremiah's experience: in the previous verse memory had rought him to deep humiliation of soul: "My soul hath them still in emembrance, and is humbled in me;" and now this same memory restored im to life and comfort. "This I recall to my mind, therefore have I ope." Like a two-edged sword, his memory first killed his pride with ne edge, and then slew his despair with the other. As a general rinciple, if we would exercise our memories more wisely, we might, in ur very darkest distress, strike a match which would instantaneously indle the lamp of comfort. There is no need for God to create a new hing upon the earth in order to restore believers to joy; if they ould prayerfully rake the ashes of the past, they would find light for he present; and if they would turn to the book of truth and the throne f grace, their candle would soon shine as aforetime. Be it ours to emember the lovingkindness of the Lord, and to rehearse his deeds of race. Let us open the volume of recollection which is so richly lluminated with memorials of mercy, and we shall soon be happy. Thus emory may be, as Coleridge calls it, "the bosom-spring of joy," and hen the Divine Comforter bends it to his service, it may be chief mong earthly comforters.</p>

Thrice it assailed im in different forms, but ever he met it with, "Get thee behind me, atan." He hated it in others; none the less fervently because he howed his hate oftener in tears of pity than in words of rebuke; yet hat language could be more stern, more Elijah-like, than the words,</p>
<p>"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' ouses, and for a pretence make long prayer." He hated wickedness, so uch that he bled to wound it to the heart; he died that it might die; e was buried that he might bury it in his tomb; and he rose that he ight forever trample it beneath his feet. Christ is in the Gospel, and hat Gospel is opposed to wickedness in every shape. Wickedness arrays tself in fair garments, and imitates the language of holiness; but the recepts of Jesus, like his famous scourge of small cords, chase it out f the temple, and will not tolerate it in the Church. So, too, in the eart where Jesus reigns, what war there is between Christ and Belial! nd when our Redeemer shall come to be our Judge, those thundering ords, "Depart, ye cursed" which are, indeed, but a prolongation of his ife-teaching concerning sin, shall manifest his abhorrence of niquity. As warm as is his love to sinners, so hot is his hatred of in; as perfect as is his righteousness, so complete shall be the estruction of every form of wickedness.

Although they may now a little about almost all our pains and ills, there is usually one isease which they have studied above all others; but Jesus Christ is horoughly acquainted with the whole of human nature. He is as much at ome with one sinner as with another, and never yet did he meet with an ut-of-the-way case that was difficult to him. He has had extraordinary omplications of strange diseases to deal with, but he has known xactly with one glance of his eye how to treat the patient. He is the nly universal doctor; and the medicine he gives is the only true atholicon, healing in every instance. Whatever our spiritual malady ay be, we should apply at once to this Divine Physician. There is no rokenness of heart which Jesus cannot bind up. "His blood cleanseth rom all sin." We have but to think of the myriads who have been elivered from all sorts of diseases through the power and virtue of is touch, and we shall joyfully put ourselves in his hands. We trust im, and sin dies; we love him, and grace lives; we wait for him and race is strengthened; we see him as he is, and grace is perfected orever.</p>

<p>Was it so even in the beginning? Did light and darkness divide the ealm of time in the first day? Then little wonder is it if I have also hanges in my circumstances from the sunshine of prosperity to the idnight of adversity. It will not always be the blaze of noon even in y soul concerns, I must expect at seasons to mourn the absence of my ormer joys, and seek my Beloved in the night. Nor am I alone in this, or all the Lord's beloved ones have had to sing the mingled song of udgment and of mercy, of trial and deliverance, of mourning and of elight. It is one of the arrangements of Divine providence that day nd night shall not cease either in the spiritual or natural creation ill we reach the land of which it is written, "there is no night here."

<p>What, then, my soul, is it best for thee to do? Learn first to be ontent with this divine order, and be willing, with Job, to receive vil from the hand of the Lord as well as good. Study next, to make the utgoings of the morning and the evening to rejoice. Praise the Lord or the sun of joy when it rises, and for the gloom of evening as it alls. There is beauty both in sunrise and sunset; sing of it, and lorify the Lord. Like the nightingale, pour forth thy notes at all ours. Believe that the night is as useful as the day. The dews of race fall heavily in the night of sorrow. The stars of promise shine orth gloriously amid the darkness of grief. Continue thy service under ll changes.

<p>In every believer's heart there is a constant struggle between the old ature and the new. The old nature is very active, and loses no pportunity of plying all the weapons of its deadly armoury against ewborn grace; while on the other hand, the new nature is ever on the atch to resist and destroy its enemy. Grace within us will employ rayer, and faith, and hope, and love, to cast out the evil; it takes nto it the "whole armour of God," and wrestles earnestly. These two pposing natures will never cease to struggle so long as we are in this orld. The battle of "Christian" with "Apollyon" lasted three hours, ut the battle of Christian with himself lasted all the way from the icket Gate to the river Jordan. The enemy is so securely entrenched ithin us that he can never be driven out while we are in this body: ut although we are closely beset, and often in sore conflict, we have n Almighty helper, even Jesus, the Captain of our salvation, who is ver with us, and who assures us that we shall eventually come off more han conquerors through Him. With such assistance the new-born nature s more than a match for its foes. Are you fighting with the adversary oday? Are Satan, the world, and the flesh, all against you? Be not iscouraged nor dismayed. Fight on! For God Himself is with you; ehovah Nissi is your banner, and Jehovah Rophi is the healer of your ounds.

<p>If the young man in the gospel used this title in speaking to our Lord, ow much more fitly may I thus address him! He is indeed my Master in oth senses, a ruling Master and a teaching Master.

I am both his servant and his isciple, and count it my highest honour to own the double character. f he should ask me why I call him "good," I should have a ready nswer. It is true that "there is none good but one, that is, God," but hen he is God, and all the goodness of Deity shines forth in him. In y experience, I have found him good, so good, indeed, that all the ood I have has come to me through him. He was good to me when I was ead in sin, for he raised me by his Spirit's power; he has been good o me in all my needs, trials, struggles, and sorrows. Never could here be a better Master, for his service is freedom, his rule is love:  wish I were one thousandth part as good a servant. When he teaches me s my Rabbi, he is unspeakably good, his doctrine is divine, his manner s condescending, his spirit is gentleness itself. No error mingles ith his instruction--pure is the golden truth which he brings forth, nd all his teachings lead to goodness, sanctifying as well as edifying he disciple. Angels find him a good Master and delight to pay their omage at his footstool. The ancient saints proved him to be a good aster, and each of them rejoiced to sing, "I am thy servant, O Lord!" My own humble testimony must certainly be to the same effect. I will ear this witness before my friends and neighbours, for possibly they ay be led by my testimony to seek my Lord Jesus as their Master. O hat they would do so! They would never repent so wise a deed. If they ould but take his easy yoke, they would find themselves in so royal a ervice that they would enlist in it forever.</p>

Was he ot on earth always stripping off first one robe of honour and then nother, till, naked, he was fastened to the cross, and there did he ot empty out his inmost self, pouring out his life-blood, giving up or all of us, till they laid him penniless in a borrowed grave? How ow was our dear Redeemer brought! How then can we be proud? Stand at he foot of the cross, and count the purple drops by which you have een cleansed; see the thorn-crown; mark his scourged shoulders, still ushing with encrimsoned rills; see hands and feet given up to the ough iron, and his whole self to mockery and scorn; see the itterness, and the pangs, and the throes of inward grief, showing hemselves in his outward frame; hear the thrilling shriek, "My God, my od, why hast thou forsaken me?"

You were so lost hat nothing could save you but the sacrifice of God's only begotten. hink of that, and as Jesus stooped for you, bow yourself in lowliness t his feet. A sense of Christ's amazing love to us has a greater endency to humble us than even a consciousness of our own guilt.

In those grand old ges, which are the heroic period of the Christian religion, this ouble mark was clearly to be seen in all believers in Jesus; they were en who knew the love of Christ, and rested upon it as a man leaneth pon a staff whose trustiness he has tried. The love which they felt owards the Lord was not a quiet emotion which they hid within hemselves in the secret chamber of their souls, and which they only pake of in their private assemblies when they met on the first day of he week, and sang hymns in honour of Christ Jesus the crucified, but t was a passion with them of such a vehement and all-consuming energy, hat it was visible in all their actions, spoke in their common talk, nd looked out of their eyes even in their commonest glances.

<p>If you would see souls converted, if you would hear the cry that "the ingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord;" if you ould place crowns upon the head of the Saviour, and his throne lifted igh, then be filled with zeal. For, under God, the way of the world's onversion must be by the zeal of the church. Every grace shall do xploits, but this shall be first; prudence, knowledge, patience, and ourage will follow in their places, but zeal must lead the van. It is ot the extent of your knowledge, though that is useful; it is not the xtent of your talent, though that is not to be despised; it is your eal that shall do great exploits. This zeal is the fruit of the Holy pirit: it draws its vital force from the continued operations of the oly Ghost in the soul. If our inner life dwindles, if our heart beats lowly before God, we shall not know zeal; but if all be strong and igorous within, then we cannot but feel a loving anxiety to see the ingdom of Christ come, and his will done on earth, even as it is in eaven. A deep sense of gratitude will nourish Christian zeal. Looking o the hole of the pit whence we were digged, we find abundant reason hy we should spend and be spent for God. And zeal is also stimulated y the thought of the eternal future. It looks with tearful eyes down o the flames of hell, and it cannot slumber: it looks up with anxious aze to the glories of heaven, and it cannot but bestir itself. It eels that time is short compared with the work to be done, and herefore it devotes all that it has to the cause of its Lord. And it s ever strengthened by the remembrance of Christ's example. He was lothed with zeal as with a cloak. How swift the chariot-wheels of duty ent with him! He knew no loitering by the way. Let us prove that we re his disciples by manifesting the same spirit of zeal.</p>

<p>God had made a positive promise to Moses that for the space of a whole onth he would feed the vast host in the wilderness with flesh. Moses, eing overtaken by a fit of unbelief, looks to the outward means, and s at a loss to know how the promise can be fulfilled. He looked to the reature instead of the Creator. But doth the Creator expect the reature to fulfil his promise for him? No; he who makes the promise ver fulfils it by his own unaided omnipotence. If he speaks, it is one--done by himself. His promises do not depend for their fulfilment pon the co-operation of the puny strength of man. We can at once erceive the mistake which Moses made. And yet how commonly we do the ame! God has promised to supply our needs, and we look to the creature o do what God has promised to do; and then, because we perceive the reature to be weak and feeble, we indulge in unbelief. Why look we to hat quarter at all? Will you look to the north pole to gather fruits ipened in the sun? Verily, you would act no more foolishly if ye did his than when you look to the weak for strength, and to the creature o do the Creator's work. Let us, then, put the question on the right ooting. The ground of faith is not the sufficiency of the visible eans for the performance of the promise, but the all-sufficiency of he invisible God, who will most surely do as he hath said. If after learly seeing that the onus lies with the Lord and not with the reature, we dare to indulge in mistrust, the question of God comes ome mightily to us: "Has the Lord's hand waxed short?" May it happen, oo, in his mercy, that with the question there may flash upon our ouls that blessed declaration, "Thou shalt see now whether my word hall come to pass unto thee or not."</p>

But a Christian whose soul is in a healthy state, will come orward joyously, and say, "I will speak, not about myself, but to the onour of my God. He hath brought me up out of an horrible pit, and out f the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my oings: and he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our od.

In looking back, it ould be wrong to deny that we have been in the Slough of Despond, and ave crept along the Valley of Humiliation, but it would be equally icked to forget that we have been through them safely and profitably; e have not remained in them, thanks to our Almighty Helper and Leader, ho has brought us "out into a wealthy place."

<p>The Greek word here rendered search signifies a strict, close, iligent, curious search, such as men make when they are seeking gold, r hunters when they are in earnest after game. We must not rest ontent with having given a superficial reading to a chapter or two, ut with the candle of the Spirit we must deliberately seek out the idden meaning of the word. Holy Scripture requires searching--much of t can only be learned by careful study. There is milk for babes, but lso meat for strong men. The rabbis wisely say that a mountain of atter hangs upon every word, yea, upon every title of Scripture. ertullian exclaims, "I adore the fulness of the Scriptures." No man ho merely skims the book of God can profit thereby; we must dig and ine until we obtain the hid treasure. The door of the word only opens o the key of diligence. The Scriptures claim searching. They are the ritings of God, bearing the divine stamp and imprimatur--who shall are to treat them with levity? He who despises them despises the God ho wrote them. God forbid that any of us should leave our Bibles to ecome swift witnesses against us in the great day of account. The word f God will repay searching. God does not bid us sift a mountain of haff with here and there a grain of wheat in it, but the Bible is innowed corn--we have but to open the granary door and find it. cripture grows upon the student. It is full of surprises. Under the eaching of the Holy Spirit, to the searching eye it glows with plendour of revelation, like a vast temple paved with wrought gold, nd roofed with rubies, emeralds, and all manner of gems. No erchandise is like the merchandise of Scripture truth. Lastly, the criptures reveal Jesus: "They are they which testify of me." No more owerful motive can be urged upon Bible readers than this: he who finds esus finds life, heaven, all things. Happy he who, searching his ible, discovers his Saviour.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is the Alpha and Omega of the Bible. He is the constant heme of its sacred pages; from first to last they testify of him.

Prophets and kings, priests and preachers, all look one ay--they all stand as the cherubs did over the ark, desiring to look ithin, and to read the mystery of God's great propitiation. Still more anifestly in the New Testament we find our Lord the one pervading ubject. It is not an ingot here and there, or dust of gold thinly cattered, but here you stand upon a solid floor of gold; for the whole ubstance of the New Testament is Jesus crucified, and even its closing entence is bejewelled with the Redeemer's name.

<p>It is well frequently to weigh ourselves in the scale of God's Word. ou will find it a holy exercise to read some psalm of David, and, as ou meditate upon each verse, to ask yourself, "Can I say this?

<div class="response">
<p>The apostle uses the perfect tense and says, "Who hath saved us." Believers in Christ Jesus are saved. They are not looked upon as ersons who are in a hopeful state, and may ultimately be saved, but hey are already saved. Salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed upon he dying bed, and to be sung of in a future state above, but a matter o be obtained, received, promised, and enjoyed now. The Christian is erfectly saved in God's purpose; God has ordained him unto salvation, nd that purpose is complete. He is saved also as to the price which as been paid for him: "It is finished" was the cry of the Saviour ere e died. The believer is also perfectly saved in his covenant head, for s he fell in Adam, so he lives in Christ. This complete salvation is ccompanied by a holy calling. Those whom the Saviour saved upon the ross are in due time effectually called by the power of God the Holy pirit unto holiness: they leave their sins; they endeavour to be like hrist; they choose holiness, not out of any compulsion, but from the tress of a new nature, which leads them to rejoice in holiness just as aturally as aforetime they delighted in sin. God neither chose them or called them because they were holy, but he called them that they ight be holy, and holiness is the beauty produced by his workmanship n them. The excellencies which we see in a believer are as much the ork of God as the atonement itself. Thus is brought out very sweetly he fulness of the grace of God. Salvation must be of grace, because he Lord is the author of it: and what motive but grace could move him o save the guilty? Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord works n such a manner that our righteousness is forever excluded. Such is he believer's privilege--a present salvation; such is the evidence hat he is called to it--a holy life.</p>

<p>Here we have two great lessons--what to deprecate and what to upplicate. The happiest state of a Christian is the holiest state. As here is the most heat nearest to the sun, so there is the most appiness nearest to Christ. No Christian enjoys comfort when his eyes re fixed on vanity--he finds no satisfaction unless his soul is uickened in the ways of God. The world may win happiness elsewhere, ut he cannot. I do not blame ungodly men for rushing to their leasures. Why should I? Let them have their fill. That is all they ave to enjoy. A converted wife who despaired of her husband was always ery kind to him, for she said, "I fear that this is the only world in hich he will be happy, and therefore I have made up my mind to make im as happy as I can in it." Christians must seek their delights in a igher sphere than the insipid frivolities or sinful enjoyments of the orld. Vain pursuits are dangerous to renewed souls. We have heard of a hilosopher who, while he looked up to the stars, fell into a pit; but ow deeply do they fall who look down. Their fall is fatal. No hristian is safe when his soul is slothful, and his God is far from im. Every Christian is always safe as to the great matter of his tanding in Christ, but he is not safe as regards his experience in oliness, and communion with Jesus in this life. Satan does not often ttack a Christian who is living near to God. It is when the Christian eparts from his God, becomes spiritually starved, and endeavours to eed on vanities, that the devil discovers his vantage hour. He may ometimes stand foot to foot with the child of God who is active in his aster's service, but the battle is generally short: he who slips as he oes down into the Valley of Humiliation, every time he takes a false tep invites Apollyon to assail him.

<p>The teaching of these words must seem very surprising to those who are trangers to vital godliness, but to the sincere believer it is only he inculcation of a recognized truth. The life of the believer is here escribed as a delight in God, and we are thus certified of the great act that true religion overflows with happiness and joy. Ungodly ersons and mere professors never look upon religion as a joyful thing; o them it is service, duty, or necessity, but never pleasure or elight. If they attend to religion at all, it is either that they may ain thereby, or else because they dare not do otherwise. The thought f delight in religion is so strange to most men, that no two words in heir language stand further apart than "holiness" and "delight." But elievers who know Christ, understand that delight and faith are so lessedly united, that the gates of hell cannot prevail to separate hem. They who love God with all their hearts, find that his ways are ays of pleasantness, and all his paths are peace. Such joys, such rimful delights, such overflowing blessednesses, do the saints iscover in their Lord, that so far from serving him from custom, they ould follow him though all the world cast out his name as evil. We ear not God because of any compulsion; our faith is no fetter, our rofession is no bondage, we are not dragged to holiness, nor driven to uty.

<p>A deep sense and clear sight of sin, its heinousness, and the unishment which it deserves, should make us lie low before the throne. e have sinned as Christians. Alas! that it should be so.

Who is there, although he ay long have been engaged in the Christian warfare, that will not lush when he looks back upon the past? As for our days before we were egenerated, may they be forgiven and forgotten; but since then, though e have not sinned as before, yet we have sinned against light and gainst love--light which has really penetrated our minds, and love in hich we have rejoiced. Oh, the atrocity of the sin of a pardoned soul! n unpardoned sinner sins cheaply compared with the sin of one of God's wn elect ones, who has had communion with Christ and leaned his head pon Jesus' bosom. Look at David! Many will talk of his sin, but I pray ou look at his repentance, and hear his broken bones, as each one of hem moans out its dolorous confession! Mark his tears, as they fall pon the ground, and the deep sighs with which he accompanies the oftened music of his harp! We have erred: let us, therefore, seek the pirit of penitence. Look, again, at Peter! We speak much of Peter's enying his Master. Remember, it is written, "He wept bitterly." Have e no denials of our Lord to be lamented with tears? Alas! these sins f ours, before and after conversion, would consign us to the place of nextinguishable fire if it were not for the sovereign mercy which has ade us to differ, snatching us like brands from the burning. My soul, ow down under a sense of thy natural sinfulness, and worship thy God. dmire the grace which saves thee--the mercy which spares thee--the ove which pardons thee!</p>

Well may my outh be filled with joyous laughter, because of the singular, urprising grace which I have received of the Lord, for I have found esus, the promised seed, and he is mine forever. This day will I lift p psalms of triumph unto the Lord who has remembered my low estate, or "my heart rejoiceth in the Lord; mine horn is exalted in the Lord; y mouth is enlarged over mine enemies, because I rejoice in thy alvation."</p>
<p>I would have all those that hear of my great deliverance from hell, and y most blessed visitation from on high, laugh for joy with me.

<blockquote>
<p>The Lord is my light and my salvation." Here is personal interest, "my ight," "my salvation;" the soul is assured of it, and therefore eclares it boldly. Into the soul at the new birth divine light is oured as the precursor of salvation; where there is not enough light o reveal our own darkness and to make us long for the Lord Jesus, here is no evidence of salvation. After conversion our God is our joy, omfort, guide, teacher, and in every sense our light: he is light ithin, light around, light reflected from us, and light to be revealed o us. Note, it is not said merely that the Lord gives light, but that e is light; nor that he gives salvation, but that he is salvation; he, hen, who by faith has laid hold upon God, has all covenant blessings n his possession. This being made sure as a fact, the argument drawn rom it is put in the form of a question, "Whom shall I fear?" A uestion which is its own answer. The powers of darkness are not to be eared, for the Lord, our light, destroys them; and the damnation of ell is not to be dreaded by us, for the Lord is our salvation. This is  very different challenge from that of boastful Goliath, for it rests, ot upon the conceited vigour of an arm of flesh, but upon the real ower of the omnipotent I AM. "The Lord is the strength of my life.</p>

<p>Help, Lord.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Psalm</span> <span class="chapter">12</span>:<span class="verse">1</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>The prayer itself is remarkable, for it is short, but seasonable, ententious, and suggestive. David mourned the fewness of faithful men, nd therefore lifted up his heart in supplication--when the creature ailed, he flew to the Creator. He evidently felt his own weakness, or e would not have cried for help; but at the same time he intended onestly to exert himself for the cause of truth, for the word "help" is inapplicable where we ourselves do nothing. There is much of irectness, clearness of perception, and distinctness of utterance in his petition of two words; much more, indeed, than in the long ambling outpourings of certain professors. The Psalmist runs traight-forward to his God, with a well-considered prayer; he knows hat he is seeking, and where to seek it. Lord, teach us to pray in the ame blessed manner.</p>
<p>The occasions for the use of this prayer are frequent. In providential fflictions how suitable it is for tried believers who find all helpers ailing them. Students, in doctrinal difficulties, may often obtain aid y lifting up this cry of "Help, Lord," to the Holy Spirit, the great eacher. Spiritual warriors in inward conflicts may send to the throne or reinforcements, and this will be a model for their request. Workers n heavenly labour may thus obtain grace in time of need. Seeking inners, in doubts and alarms, may offer up the same weighty upplication; in fact, in all these cases, times, and places, this will erve the turn of needy souls. "Help, Lord," will suit us living and ying, suffering or labouring, rejoicing or sorrowing. In him our help s found, let us not be slack to cry to him.</p>
<p>The answer to the prayer is certain, if it be sincerely offered through esus. The Lord's character assures us that he will not leave his eople; his relationship as Father and Husband guarantee us his aid; is gift of Jesus is a pledge of every good thing; and his sure promise tands, "Fear not, I will help thee."</p>

<p>Famous was the well of Beer in the wilderness, because it was the ubject of a promise: "That is the well whereof the Lord spake unto oses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water." The eople needed water, and it was promised by their gracious God. We need resh supplies of heavenly grace, and in the covenant the Lord has ledged himself to give all we require. The well next became the cause f a song. Before the water gushed forth, cheerful faith prompted the eople to sing; and as they saw the crystal fount bubbling up, the usic grew yet more joyous. In like manner, we who believe the promise f God should rejoice in the prospect of divine revivals in our souls, nd as we experience them our holy joy should overflow. Are we hirsting? Let us not murmur, but sing. Spiritual thirst is bitter to ear, but we need not bear it--the promise indicates a well; let us be f good heart, and look for it. Moreover, the well was the centre of rayer. "Spring up, O well." What God has engaged to give, we must nquire after, or we manifest that we have neither desire nor faith. his evening let us ask that the Scripture we have read, and our evotional exercises, may not be an empty formality, but a channel of race to our souls. O that God the Holy Spirit would work in us with ll his mighty power, filling us with all the fulness of God. Lastly, he well was the object of effort. "The nobles of the people digged it ith their staves." The Lord would have us active in obtaining grace. ur staves are ill adapted for digging in the sand, but we must use hem to the utmost of our ability. Prayer must not be neglected; the ssembling of ourselves together must not be forsaken; ordinances must ot be slighted. The Lord will give us his peace most plenteously, but ot in a way of idleness. Let us, then, bestir ourselves to seek him in hom are all our fresh springs.</p>

<p>The heart of the believer is Christ's garden. He bought it with his recious blood, and he enters it and claims it as his own. A garden mplies separation. It is not the open common; it is not a wilderness; t is walled around, or hedged in. Would that we could see the wall of eparation between the church and the world made broader and stronger. t makes one sad to hear Christians saying, "Well, there is no harm in his; there is no harm in that," thus getting as near to the world as ossible. Grace is at a low ebb in that soul which can even raise the uestion of how far it may go in worldly conformity. A garden is a lace of beauty, it far surpasses the wild uncultivated lands. The enuine Christian must seek to be more excellent in his life than the est moralist, because Christ's garden ought to produce the best lowers in all the world. Even the best is poor compared with Christ's eservings; let us not put him off with withering and dwarf plants. The arest, richest, choicest lilies and roses ought to bloom in the place hich Jesus calls his own. The garden is a place of growth. The saints re not to remain undeveloped, always mere buds and blossoms. We should row in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus hrist. Growth should be rapid where Jesus is the Husbandman, and the oly Spirit the dew from above. A garden is a place of retirement. So he Lord Jesus Christ would have us reserve our souls as a place in hich he can manifest himself, as he doth not unto the world. O that hristians were more retired, that they kept their hearts more closely hut up for Christ! We often worry and trouble ourselves, like Martha, ith much serving, so that we have not the room for Christ that Mary ad, and do not sit at his feet as we should.

<p>Oh, Jesus! thy power, thy grace, thy justice, thy tenderness, thy ruth, thy majesty, and thine immutability make up such a man, or ather such a God-man, as neither heaven nor earth hath seen elsewhere. hy infancy, thy eternity, thy sufferings, thy triumphs, thy death, and hine immortality, are all woven in one gorgeous tapestry, without seam r rent. Thou art music without discord; thou art many, and yet not ivided; thou art all things, and yet not diverse. As all the colours lend into one resplendent rainbow, so all the glories of heaven and arth meet in thee, and unite so wondrously, that there is none like hee in all things; nay, if all the virtues of the most excellent were ound in one bundle, they could not rival thee, thou mirror of all erfection. Thou hast been anointed with the holy oil of myrrh and assia, which thy God hath reserved for thee alone; and as for thy ragrance, it is as the holy perfume, the like of which none other can ver mingle, even with the art of the apothecary; each spice is ragrant, but the compound is divine.</p>
<p>"Oh, sacred symmetry! oh, rare connection</p>
<p>Of many perfects, to make one perfection!</p>
<p>Oh, heavenly music, where all parts do meet</p>
<p>In one sweet strain, to make one perfect sweet!"</p>

<p>The foundation of God standeth sure.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">2 Timothy</span> <span class="chapter">2</span>:<span class="verse">19</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>The foundation upon which our faith rests is this, that "God was in hrist reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their respasses unto them." The great fact on which genuine faith relies is, hat "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us," and that "Christ lso hath suffered for sin, the just for the unjust, that he might ring us to God"; "Who himself bare our sins in his own body on the ree"; "For the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his tripes we are healed." In one word, the great pillar of the hristian's hope is substitution. The vicarious sacrifice of Christ for he guilty, Christ being made sin for us that we might be made the ighteousness of God in him, Christ offering up a true and proper xpiatory and substitutionary sacrifice in the room, place, and stead f as many as the Father gave him, who are known to God by name, and re recognized in their own hearts by their trusting in Jesus--this is he cardinal fact of the gospel. If this foundation were removed, what ould we do? But it standeth firm as the throne of God. We know it; we est on it; we rejoice in it; and our delight is to hold it, to editate upon it, and to proclaim it, while we desire to be actuated nd moved by gratitude for it in every part of our life and onversation. In these days a direct attack is made upon the doctrine f the atonement. Men cannot bear substitution. They gnash their teeth t the thought of the Lamb of God bearing the sin of man. But we, who now by experience the preciousness of this truth, will proclaim it in efiance of them confidently and unceasingly. We will neither dilute it or change it, nor fritter it away in any shape or fashion. It shall till be Christ, a positive substitute, bearing human guilt and uffering in the stead of men. We cannot, dare not, give it up, for it s our life, and despite every controversy we feel that "Nevertheless he foundation of God standeth sure."</p>

<p>Christ himself is the builder of his spiritual temple, and he has built t on the mountains of his unchangeable affection, his omnipotent race, and his infallible truthfulness. But as it was in Solomon's emple, so in this; the materials need making ready. There are the "Cedars of Lebanon," but they are not framed for the building; they are ot cut down, and shaped, and made into those planks of cedar, whose doriferous beauty shall make glad the courts of the Lord's house in aradise. There are also the rough stones still in the quarry, they ust be hewn thence, and squared. All this is Christ's own work. Each ndividual believer is being prepared, and polished, and made ready for is place in the temple; but Christ's own hand performs the reparation-work. Afflictions cannot sanctify, excepting as they are sed by him to this end. Our prayers and efforts cannot make us ready or heaven, apart from the hand of Jesus, who fashioneth our hearts right.</p>
<p>As in the building of Solomon's temple, "there was neither hammer, nor xe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house," because all was brought erfectly ready for the exact spot it was to occupy--so is it with the emple which Jesus builds; the making ready is all done on earth. When e reach heaven, there will be no sanctifying us there, no squaring us ith affliction, no planing us with suffering. No, we must be made meet ere--all that Christ will do beforehand; and when he has done it, we hall be ferried by a loving hand across the stream of death, and rought to the heavenly Jerusalem, to abide as eternal pillars in the emple of our Lord.</p>
<p>"Beneath his eye and care,</p>
<p>The edifice shall rise,</p>

<p>We have many things in our possession at the present moment which can e shaken, and it ill becomes a Christian man to set much store by hem, for there is nothing stable beneath these rolling skies; change s written upon all things. Yet, we have certain "things which cannot e shaken," and I invite you this evening to think of them, that if the hings which can be shaken should all be taken away, you may derive eal comfort from the things that cannot be shaken, which will remain. hatever your losses have been, or may be, you enjoy present salvation. ou are standing at the foot of his cross, trusting alone in the merit f Jesus' precious blood, and no rise or fall of the markets can nterfere with your salvation in him; no breaking of banks, no failures nd bankruptcies can touch that. Then you are a child of God this vening. God is your Father. No change of circumstances can ever rob ou of that. Although by losses brought to poverty, and stripped bare, ou can say, "He is my Father still. In my Father's house are many ansions; therefore will I not be troubled." You have another permanent lessing, namely, the love of Jesus Christ. He who is God and Man loves ou with all the strength of his affectionate nature--nothing can ffect that. The fig tree may not blossom, and the flocks may cease rom the field, it matters not to the man who can sing, "My Beloved is ine, and I am his." Our best portion and richest heritage we cannot ose. Whatever troubles come, let us play the man; let us show that we re not such little children as to be cast down by what may happen in his poor fleeting state of time. Our country is Immanuel's land, our ope is above the sky, and therefore, calm as the summer's ocean; we ill see the wreck of everything earthborn, and yet rejoice in the God f our salvation.</p>

To be sanctified, spirit, soul, and body, should be thine im and prayer; and although sanctification may not be perfect in thee nywhere in degree, yet it must be universal in its action; there must ot be the appearance of holiness in one place and reigning sin in nother, else thou, too, wilt be a cake not turned.</p>
<p>A cake not turned is soon burnt on the side nearest the fire, and lthough no man can have too much religion, there are some who seem urnt black with bigoted zeal for that part of truth which they have eceived, or are charred to a cinder with a vainglorious Pharisaic stentation of those religious performances which suit their humour. he assumed appearance of superior sanctity frequently accompanies a otal absence of all vital godliness.

"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it oth not yet appear what we shall be."

<p>It is fondly imagined by some that it must have involved very special rivileges to have been the mother of our Lord, because they supposed hat she had the benefit of looking into his very heart in a way in hich we cannot hope to do. There may be an appearance of plausibility n the supposition, but not much. We do not know that Mary knew more han others; what she did know she did well to lay up in her heart; but he does not appear from anything we read in the Evangelists to have een a better-instructed believer than any other of Christ's disciples. ll that she knew we also may discover. Do you wonder that we should ay so? Here is a text to prove it: "The secret of the Lord is with hem that fear him, and he will show them his covenant." Remember the aster's words--"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant noweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all hings that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you." So lessedly does this Divine Revealer of secrets tell us his heart, that e keepeth back nothing which is profitable to us; his own assurance s, "If it were not so, I would have told you." Doth he not this day anifest himself unto us as he doth not unto the world? It is even so; nd therefore we will not ignorantly cry out, "Blessed is the womb that are thee," but we will intelligently bless God that, having heard the ord and kept it, we have first of all as true a communion with the aviour as the Virgin had, and in the second place as true an cquaintance with the secrets of his heart as she can be supposed to ave obtained.

<p>The narrative of the manly courage and marvellous deliverance of the hree holy children, or rather champions, is well calculated to excite n the minds of believers firmness and steadfastness in upholding the ruth in the teeth of tyranny and in the very jaws of death. Let young hristians especially learn from their example, both in matters of aith in religion, and matters of uprightness in business, never to acrifice their consciences. Lose all rather than lose your integrity, nd when all else is gone, still hold fast a clear conscience as the arest jewel which can adorn the bosom of a mortal. Be not guided by he will-o'-the-wisp of policy, but by the pole-star of divine uthority. Follow the right at all hazards. When you see no present dvantage, walk by faith and not by sight. Do God the honour to trust im when it comes to matters of loss for the sake of principle. See hether he will be your debtor! See if he doth not even in this life rove his word that "Godliness, with contentment, is great gain," and hat they who "seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, hall have all these things added unto them." Should it happen that, in he providence of God, you are a loser by conscience, you shall find hat if the Lord pays you not back in the silver of earthly prosperity, e will discharge his promise in the gold of spiritual joy. Remember hat a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of that which he ossesseth. To wear a guileless spirit, to have a heart void of ffence, to have the favour and smile of God, is greater riches than he mines of Ophir could yield, or the traffic of Tyre could win. "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and nward contention therewith." An ounce of heart's-ease is worth a ton f gold.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of Christ is somewhat like climbing one of our Welsh ountains. When you are at the base you see but little: the mountain tself appears to be but one-half as high as it really is. Confined in  little valley, you discover scarcely anything but the rippling brooks s they descend into the stream at the foot of the mountain. Climb the irst rising knoll, and the valley lengthens and widens beneath your eet. Go higher, and you see the country for four or five miles round, nd you are delighted with the widening prospect. Mount still, and the cene enlarges; till at last, when you are on the summit, and look ast, west, north, and south, you see almost all England lying before ou. Yonder is a forest in some distant county, perhaps two hundred iles away, and here the sea, and there a shining river and the smoking himneys of a manufacturing town, or the masts of the ships in a busy ort. All these things please and delight you, and you say, "I could ot have imagined that so much could be seen at this elevation." Now, he Christian life is of the same order. When we first believe in hrist we see but little of him. The higher we climb the more we iscover of his beauties. But who has ever gained the summit? Who has nown all the heights and depths of the love of Christ which passes nowledge? Paul, when grown old, sitting grey-haired, shivering in a ungeon in Rome, could say with greater emphasis than we can, "I know hom I have believed," for each experience had been like the climbing f a hill, each trial had been like ascending another summit, and his eath seemed like gaining the top of the mountain, from which he could ee the whole of the faithfulness and the love of him to whom he had ommitted his soul. Get thee up, dear friend, into the high mountain.</p>

Worldly wisdom recommends he path of compromise, and talks of "moderation." According to this arnal policy, purity is admitted to be very desirable, but we are arned against being too precise; truth is of course to be followed, ut error is not to be severely denounced. "Yes," says the world, "be piritually minded by all means, but do not deny yourself a little gay ociety, an occasional ball, and a Christmas visit to a theatre.

He nsinuates, "Your sins are too great for pardon; you have no faith; you o not repent enough; you will never be able to continue to the end; ou have not the joy of his children; you have such a wavering hold of esus." All these are thoughts about self, and we shall never find omfort or assurance by looking within. But the Holy Spirit turns our yes entirely away from self: he tells us that we are nothing, but that "Christ is all in all." Remember, therefore, it is not thy hold of hrist that saves thee--it is Christ; it is not thy joy in Christ that aves thee--it is Christ; it is not even faith in Christ, though that e the instrument--it is Christ's blood and merits; therefore, look not o much to thy hand with which thou art grasping Christ, as to Christ; ook not to thy hope, but to Jesus, the source of thy hope; look not to hy faith, but to Jesus, the author and finisher of thy faith. We shall ever find happiness by looking at our prayers, our doings, or our eelings; it is what Jesus is, not what we are, that gives rest to the oul. If we would at once overcome Satan and have peace with God, it ust be by "looking unto Jesus." Keep thine eye simply on him; let his eath, his sufferings, his merits, his glories, his intercession, be resh upon thy mind; when thou wakest in the morning look to him; when hou liest down at night look to him. Oh! let not thy hopes or fears ome between thee and Jesus; follow hard after him, and he will never ail thee.</p>
<p>"My hope is built on nothing less</p>
<p>Than Jesus' blood and righteousness:</p>
<p>I dare not trust the sweetest frame,</p>
<p>But wholly lean on Jesus' name."</p>

<p>This incident is an instructive emblem of the sure victory of the ivine handiwork over all opposition. Whenever a divine principle is ast into the heart, though the devil may fashion a counterfeit, and roduce swarms of opponents, as sure as ever God is in the work, it ill swallow up all its foes. If God's grace takes possession of a man, he world's magicians may throw down all their rods; and every rod may e as cunning and poisonous as a serpent, but Aaron's rod will swallow p their rods. The sweet attractions of the cross will woo and win the an's heart, and he who lived only for this deceitful earth will now ave an eye for the upper spheres, and a wing to mount into celestial eights. When grace has won the day the worldling seeks the world to ome. The same fact is to be observed in the life of the believer. What ultitudes of foes has our faith had to meet! Our old sins--the devil hrew them down before us, and they turned to serpents. What hosts of hem! Ah, but the cross of Jesus destroys them all. Faith in Christ akes short work of all our sins. Then the devil has launched forth nother host of serpents in the form of worldly trials, temptations, nbelief; but faith in Jesus is more than a match for them, and vercomes them all. The same absorbing principle shines in the faithful ervice of God! With an enthusiastic love for Jesus difficulties are urmounted, sacrifices become pleasures, sufferings are honours. But if eligion is thus a consuming passion in the heart, then it follows that here are many persons who profess religion but have it not; for what hey have will not bear this test. Examine yourself, my reader, on this oint. Aaron's rod proved its heaven-given power. Is your religion oing so? If Christ be anything he must be everything. O rest not till ove and faith in Jesus be the master passions of your soul!</p>

<p>At the very time when the Chaldeans surrounded Jerusalem, and when the word, famine and pestilence had desolated the land, Jeremiah was ommanded by God to purchase a field, and have the deed of transfer egally sealed and witnessed. This was a strange purchase for a ational man to make. Prudence could not justify it, for it was buying ith scarcely a probability that the person purchasing could ever enjoy he possession. But it was enough for Jeremiah that his God had bidden im, for well he knew that God will be justified of all his children. e reasoned thus: "Ah, Lord God! thou canst make this plot of ground of se to me; thou canst rid this land of these oppressors; thou canst ake me yet sit under my vine and my fig-tree in the heritage which I ave bought; for thou didst make the heavens and the earth, and there s nothing too hard for thee." This gave a majesty to the early saints, hat they dared to do at God's command things which carnal reason would ondemn. Whether it be a Noah who is to build a ship on dry land, an braham who is to offer up his only son, or a Moses who is to despise he treasures of Egypt, or a Joshua who is to besiege Jericho seven ays, using no weapons but the blasts of rams' horns, they all act upon od's command, contrary to the dictates of carnal reason; and the Lord ives them a rich reward as the result of their obedient faith. Would o God we had in the religion of these modern times a more potent nfusion of this heroic faith in God. If we would venture more upon the aked promise of God, we should enter a world of wonders to which as et we are strangers.

<p>Blessed is the fact that Christians can rejoice even in the deepest istress; although trouble may surround them, they still sing; and, ike many birds, they sing best in their cages. The waves may roll over hem, but their souls soon rise to the surface and see the light of od's countenance; they have a buoyancy about them which keeps their ead always above the water, and helps them to sing amid the tempest, "God is with me still." To whom shall the glory be given? Oh! to esus--it is all by Jesus. Trouble does not necessarily bring onsolation with it to the believer, but the presence of the Son of God n the fiery furnace with him fills his heart with joy. He is sick and uffering, but Jesus visits him and makes his bed for him. He is dying, nd the cold chilly waters of Jordan are gathering about him up to the eck, but Jesus puts His arms around him, and cries, "Fear not, eloved; to die is to be blessed; the waters of death have their ountain-head in heaven; they are not bitter, they are sweet as nectar, or they flow from the throne of God." As the departing saint wades hrough the stream, and the billows gather around him, and heart and lesh fail him, the same voice sounds in his ears, "Fear not; I am with hee; be not dismayed; I am thy God." As he nears the borders of the nfinite unknown, and is almost affrighted to enter the realm of hades, Jesus says, "Fear not, it is your Father's good pleasure to ive you the kingdom." Thus strengthened and consoled, the believer is ot afraid to die; nay, he is even willing to depart, for since he has een Jesus as the morning star, he longs to gaze upon Him as the sun in is strength.

<p>A cry is the natural expression of sorrow, and a suitable utterance hen all other modes of appeal fail us; but the cry must be alone irected to the Lord, for to cry to man is to waste our entreaties upon he air.

It will be in vain to call to the ocks in the day of judgment, but our Rock attends to our cries.</p>
<p>"Be not silent to me." Mere formalists may be content without answers o their prayers, but genuine suppliants cannot; they are not satisfied ith the results of prayer itself in calming the mind and subduing the ill--they must go further, and obtain actual replies from heaven, or hey cannot rest; and those replies they long to receive at once, they read even a little of God's silence. God's voice is often so terrible hat it shakes the wilderness; but his silence is equally full of awe o an eager suppliant. When God seems to close his ear, we must not herefore close our mouths, but rather cry with more earnestness; for hen our note grows shrill with eagerness and grief, he will not long eny us a hearing. What a dreadful case should we be in if the Lord hould become forever silent to our prayers? "Lest, if thou be silent o me, I become like them that go down into the pit." Deprived of the od who answers prayer, we should be in a more pitiable plight than the ead in the grave, and should soon sink to the same level as the lost n hell. We must have answers to prayer: ours is an urgent case of dire ecessity; surely the Lord will speak peace to our agitated minds, for e never can find it in his heart to permit his own elect to perish.</p>

Neither are we to conclude that all a Christian's sufferings re sufferings with Christ, for it is essential that he be called by od to suffer. If we are rash and imprudent, and run into positions for hich neither providence nor grace has fitted us, we ought to question hether we are not rather sinning than communing with Jesus. If we let assion take the place of judgment, and self-will reign instead of criptural authority, we shall fight the Lord's battles with the evil's weapons, and if we cut our own fingers we must not be urprised. Again, in troubles which come upon us as the result of sin, e must not dream that we are suffering with Christ. When Miriam spoke vil of Moses, and the leprosy polluted her, she was not suffering for od. Moreover, suffering which God accepts must have God's glory as its nd. If I suffer that I may earn a name, or win applause, I shall get o other reward than that of the Pharisee.

<div class="response">
<p>Sanctification begins in regeneration. The Spirit of God infuses into an that new living principle by which he becomes "a new creature" in hrist Jesus. This work, which begins in the new birth, is carried on n two ways--mortification, whereby the lusts of the flesh are subdued nd kept under; and vivification, by which the life which God has put ithin us is made to be a well of water springing up unto everlasting ife. This is carried on every day in what is called "perseverance," by hich the Christian is preserved and continued in a gracious state, and s made to abound in good works unto the praise and glory of God; and t culminates or comes to perfection, in "glory," when the soul, being horoughly purged, is caught up to dwell with holy beings at the right and of the Majesty on high. But while the Spirit of God is thus the uthor of sanctification, yet there is a visible agency employed which ust not be forgotten. "Sanctify them," said Jesus, "through thy truth: hy word is truth." The passages of Scripture which prove that the nstrument of our sanctification is the Word of God are very many. The pirit of God brings to our minds the precepts and doctrines of truth, nd applies them with power. These are heard in the ear, and being eceived in the heart, they work in us to will and to do of God's good leasure. The truth is the sanctifier, and if we do not hear or read he truth, we shall not grow in sanctification. We only progress in ound living as we progress in sound understanding. "Thy word is a lamp nto my feet and a light unto my path." Do not say of any error, "It is  mere matter of opinion." No man indulges an error of judgment, ithout sooner or later tolerating an error in practice. Hold fast the ruth, for by so holding the truth shall you be sanctified by the pirit of God.</p>

<p>Outward practical holiness is a very precious mark of grace. It is to e feared that many professors have perverted the doctrine of ustification by faith in such a way as to treat good works with ontempt; if so, they will receive everlasting contempt at the last reat day. If our hands are not clean, let us wash them in Jesus' recious blood, and so let us lift up pure hands unto God. But "clean ands" will not suffice, unless they are connected with "a pure heart." True religion is heart-work. We may wash the outside of the cup and the latter as long as we please, but if the inward parts be filthy, we are ilthy altogether in the sight of God, for our hearts are more truly urselves than our hands are; the very life of our being lies in the nner nature, and hence the imperative need of purity within. The pure n heart shall see God, all others are but blind bats.</p>
<p>The man who is born for heaven "hath not lifted up his soul unto anity." All men have their joys, by which their souls are lifted up; he worldling lifts up his soul in carnal delights, which are mere mpty vanities; but the saint loves more substantial things; like ehoshaphat, he is lifted up in the ways of the Lord. He who is content ith husks, will be reckoned with the swine. Does the world satisfy hee? Then thou hast thy reward and portion in this life; make much of t, for thou shalt know no other joy.</p>
<p>"Nor sworn deceitfully." The saints are men of honour still. The hristian man's word is his only oath; but that is as good as twenty aths of other men. False speaking will shut any man out of heaven, for  liar shall not enter into God's house, whatever may be his rofessions or doings. Reader, does the text before us condemn thee, or ost thou hope to ascend into the hill of the Lord?</p>

<div class="response">
<p>We are very apt to regard the apostolic saints as if they were "saints" in a more especial manner than the other children of God. All are "saints" whom God has called by His grace, and sanctified by His pirit; but we are apt to look upon the apostles as extraordinary eings, scarcely subject to the same weaknesses and temptations as urselves. Yet in so doing we are forgetful of this truth, that the earer a man lives to God the more intensely has he to mourn over his wn evil heart; and the more his Master honours him in his service, the ore also doth the evil of the flesh vex and tease him day by day. The act is, if we had seen the apostle Paul, we should have thought him emarkably like the rest of the chosen family: and if we had talked ith him, we should have said, "We find that his experience and ours re much the same. He is more faithful, more holy, and more deeply aught than we are, but he has the selfsame trials to endure. Nay, in ome respects he is more sorely tried than ourselves." Do not, then, ook upon the ancient saints as being exempt either from infirmities or ins; and do not regard them with that mystic reverence which will lmost make us idolaters. Their holiness is attainable even by us. We re "called to be saints" by that same voice which constrained them to heir high vocation. It is a Christian's duty to force his way into the nner circle of saintship; and if these saints were superior to us in heir attainments, as they certainly were, let us follow them; let us mulate their ardour and holiness. We have the same light that they ad, the same grace is accessible to us, and why should we rest atisfied until we have equalled them in heavenly character? They lived ith Jesus, they lived for Jesus, therefore they grew like Jesus. Let s live by the same Spirit as they did, "looking unto Jesus," and our aintship will soon be apparent.</p>

<p>Seeing that we have such a God to trust to, let us rest upon him with ll our weight; let us resolutely drive out all unbelief, and endeavour o get rid of doubts and fears, which so much mar our comfort; since here is no excuse for fear where God is the foundation of our trust. A oving parent would be sorely grieved if his child could not trust him; nd how ungenerous, how unkind is our conduct when we put so little onfidence in our heavenly Father who has never failed us, and who ever will. It were well if doubting were banished from the household f God; but it is to be feared that old Unbelief is as nimble nowadays s when the psalmist asked, "Is his mercy clean gone forever? Will he e favourable no more?" David had not made any very lengthy trial of he mighty sword of the giant Goliath, and yet he said, "There is none ike it." He had tried it once in the hour of his youthful victory, and t had proved itself to be of the right metal, and therefore he praised t ever afterwards; even so should we speak well of our God, there is one like unto him in the heaven above or the earth beneath; "To whom hen will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One." There s no rock like unto the rock of Jacob, our enemies themselves being udges. So far from suffering doubts to live in our hearts, we will ake the whole detestable crew, as Elijah did the prophets of Baal, and lay them over the brook; and for a stream to kill them at, we will elect the sacred torrent which wells forth from our Saviour's wounded ide. We have been in many trials, but we have never yet been cast here we could not find in our God all that we needed. Let us then be ncouraged to trust in the Lord forever, assured that his ever lasting trength will be, as it has been, our succour and stay.</p>

<p>Divine love is rendered conspicuous when it shines in the midst of udgments. Fair is that lone star which smiles through the rifts of the hunder clouds; bright is the oasis which blooms in the wilderness of and; so fair and so bright is love in the midst of wrath. When the sraelites provoked the Most High by their continued idolatry, he unished them by withholding both dew and rain, so that their land was isited by a sore famine; but while he did this, he took care that his wn chosen ones should be secure. If all other brooks are dry, yet hall there be one reserved for Elijah; and when that fails, God shall till preserve for him a place of sustenance; nay, not only so, the ord had not simply one "Elijah," but he had a remnant according to the lection of grace, who were hidden by fifties in a cave, and though the hole land was subject to famine, yet these fifties in the cave were ed, and fed from Ahab's table too by His faithful, God-fearing teward, Obadiah. Let us from this draw the inference, that come what ay, God's people are safe. Let convulsions shake the solid earth, let he skies themselves be rent in twain, yet amid the wreck of worlds the eliever shall be as secure as in the calmest hour of rest. If God annot save his people under heaven, he will save them in heaven. If he world becomes too hot to hold them, then heaven shall be the place f their reception and their safety. Be ye then confident, when ye hear f wars, and rumours of wars. Let no agitation distress you, but be uiet from fear of evil. Whatsoever cometh upon the earth, you, beneath he broad wings of Jehovah, shall be secure. Stay yourself upon his romise; rest in his faithfulness, and bid defiance to the blackest uture, for there is nothing in it direful for you. Your sole concern hould be to show forth to the world the blessedness of hearkening to he voice of wisdom.</p>

<p>How many are mine iniquities and sins?</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Have you ever really weighed and considered how great the sin of God's eople is? Think how heinous is your own transgression, and you will ind that not only does a sin here and there tower up like an alp, but hat your iniquities are heaped upon each other, as in the old fable of he giants who piled Pelion upon Ossa, mountain upon mountain. What an ggregate of sin there is in the life of one of the most sanctified of od's children! Attempt to multiply this, the sin of one only, by the ultitude of the redeemed, "a number which no man can number," and you ill have some conception of the great mass of the guilt of the people or whom Jesus shed his blood. But we arrive at a more adequate idea of he magnitude of sin by the greatness of the remedy provided. It is the lood of Jesus Christ, God's only and well-beloved Son. God's Son! ngels cast their crowns before him! All the choral symphonies of eaven surround his glorious throne. "God over all, blessed forever. men." And yet he takes upon himself the form of a servant, and is courged and pierced, bruised and torn, and at last slain; since othing but the blood of the incarnate Son of God could make atonement or our offences. No human mind can adequately estimate the infinite alue of the divine sacrifice, for great as is the sin of God's people, he atonement which takes it away is immeasurably greater. Therefore, he believer, even when sin rolls like a black flood, and the emembrance of the past is bitter, can yet stand before the blazing hrone of the great and holy God, and cry, "Who is he that condemneth? t is Christ that died; yea rather, that hath risen again." While the ecollection of his sin fills him with shame and sorrow, he at the same ime makes it a foil to show the brightness of mercy--guilt is the dark ight in which the fair star of divine love shines with serene plendour.</p>

<p>Saved one, consider gratefully this mandate of mercy. Note that this iat of God is majestic. In our text, we perceive a sinner with nothing n him but sin, expecting nothing but wrath; but the eternal Lord asses by in his glory; he looks, he pauses, and he pronounces the olitary but royal word, "Live." There speaks a God. Who but he could enture thus to deal with life and dispense it with a single syllable? gain, this fiat is manifold. When he saith "Live," it includes many hings. Here is judicial life. The sinner is ready to be condemned, but he mighty One saith, "Live," and he rises pardoned and absolved. It is piritual life. We knew not Jesus--our eyes could not see Christ, our ars could not hear his voice--Jehovah said "Live," and we were uickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. Moreover, it includes lory-life, which is the perfection of spiritual life. "I said unto hee, Live:" and that word rolls on through all the years of time till eath comes, and in the midst of the shadows of death, the Lord's voice s still heard, "Live!" In the morning of the resurrection it is that elf-same voice which is echoed by the arch-angel, "Live," and as holy pirits rise to heaven to be blest forever in the glory of their God, t is in the power of this same word, "Live." Note again, that it is an rresistible mandate. Saul of Tarsus is on the road to Damascus to rrest the saints of the living God. A voice is heard from heaven and a ight is seen above the brightness of the sun, and Saul is crying out, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" This mandate is a mandate of free race. When sinners are saved, it is only and solely because God will o it to magnify his free, unpurchased, unsought grace. Christians, see our position, debtors to grace; show your gratitude by earnest, hristlike lives, and as God has bidden you live, see to it that you ive in earnest.</p>

<p>Where lies the secret strength of faith? It lies in the food it feeds n; for faith studies what the promise is--an emanation of divine race, an overflowing of the great heart of God; and faith says, "My od could not have given this promise, except from love and grace; herefore it is quite certain his Word will be fulfilled." Then faith hinketh, "Who gave this promise?" It considereth not so much its reatness, as, "Who is the author of it?" She remembers that it is God ho cannot lie--God omnipotent, God immutable; and therefore concludeth hat the promise must be fulfilled; and forward she advances in this irm conviction. She remembereth,why the promise was given,--namely, or God's glory, and she feels perfectly sure that God's glory is safe, hat he will never stain his own escutcheon, nor mar the lustre of his wn crown; and therefore the promise must and will stand. Then faith lso considereth the amazing work of Christ as being a clear proof of he Father's intention to fulfil his word. "He that spared not his own on, but freely delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him lso freely give us all things?" Moreover faith looks back upon the ast, for her battles have strengthened her, and her victories have iven her courage. She remembers that God never has failed her; nay, hat he never did once fail any of his children. She recollecteth times f great peril, when deliverance came; hours of awful need, when as her ay her strength was found, and she cries, "No, I never will be led to hink that he can change and leave his servant now. Hitherto the Lord ath helped me, and he will help me still." Thus faith views each romise in its connection with the promise-giver, and, because she does o, can with assurance say, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me ll the days of my life!"</p>

<p>When the believer has begun with trembling feet to walk in the way of he Lord, he asks to be still led onward like a little child upheld by ts parent's helping hand, and he craves to be further instructed in he alphabet of truth. Experimental teaching is the burden of this rayer. David knew much, but he felt his ignorance, and desired to be till in the Lord's school: four times over in two verses he applies or a scholarship in the college of grace. It were well for many rofessors if instead of following their own devices, and cutting out ew paths of thought for themselves, they would enquire for the good ld ways of God's own truth, and beseech the Holy Ghost to give them anctified understandings and teachable spirits. "For thou art the God f my salvation." The Three-One Jehovah is the Author and Perfecter of alvation to his people. Reader, is he the God of your salvation? Do ou find in the Father's election, in the Son's atonement, and in the pirit's quickening, all the grounds of your eternal hopes? If so, you ay use this as an argument for obtaining further blessings; if the ord has ordained to save you, surely he will not refuse to instruct ou in his ways. It is a happy thing when we can address the Lord with he confidence which David here manifests, it gives us great power in rayer, and comfort in trial. "On thee do I wait all the day." Patience s the fair handmaid and daughter of faith; we cheerfully wait when we re certain that we shall not wait in vain. It is our duty and our rivilege to wait upon the Lord in service, in worship, in expectancy, n trust all the days of our life. Our faith will be tried faith, and f it be of the true kind, it will bear continued trial without ielding. We shall not grow weary of waiting upon God if we remember ow long and how graciously he once waited for us.</p>

<p>It is a delightful and profitable occupation to mark the hand of God in he lives of ancient saints, and to observe his goodness in delivering hem, his mercy in pardoning them, and his faithfulness in keeping his ovenant with them.

<p>And God divided the light from the darkness.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Genesis</span> <span class="chapter">1</span>:<span class="verse">4</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>A believer has two principles at work within him. In his natural estate e was subject to one principle only, which was darkness; now light has ntered, and the two principles disagree. Mark the apostle Paul's words n the seventh chapter of Romans: "I find then a law, that, when I ould do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God fter the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring gainst the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law f sin, which is in my members." How is this state of things ccasioned? "The Lord divided the light from the darkness." Darkness, y itself, is quiet and undisturbed, but when the Lord sends in light, here is a conflict, for the one is in opposition to the other: a onflict which will never cease till the believer is altogether light n the Lord. If there be a division within the individual Christian, here is certain to be a division without. So soon as the Lord gives to ny man light, he proceeds to separate himself from the darkness round; he secedes from a merely worldly religion of outward eremonial, for nothing short of the gospel of Christ will now satisfy im, and he withdraws himself from worldly society and frivolous musements, and seeks the company of the saints, for "We know we have assed from death unto life, because we love the brethren." The light athers to itself, and the darkness to itself. What God has divided, et us never try to unite, but as Christ went without the camp, bearing is reproach, so let us come out from the ungodly, and be a peculiar eople. He was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners; and, s he was, so we are to be nonconformists to the world, dissenting from ll sin, and distinguished from the rest of mankind by our likeness to ur Master.</p>

<p>The evening was "darkness" and the morning was "light," and yet the two ogether are called by the name that is given to the light alone! This s somewhat remarkable, but it has an exact analogy in spiritual xperience. In every believer there is darkness and light, and yet he s not to be named a sinner because there is sin in him, but he is to e named a saint because he possesses some degree of holiness. This ill be a most comforting thought to those who are mourning their nfirmities, and who ask, "Can I be a child of God while there is so uch darkness in me?" Yes; for you, like the day, take not your name rom the evening, but from the morning; and you are spoken of in the ord of God as if you were even now perfectly holy as you will be soon. ou are called the child of light, though there is darkness in you till. You are named after what is the predominating quality in the ight of God, which will one day be the only principle remaining. bserve that the evening comes first. Naturally we are darkness first n order of time, and the gloom is often first in our mournful pprehension, driving us to cry out in deep humiliation, "God be erciful to me, a sinner." The place of the morning is second, it dawns hen grace overcomes nature. It is a blessed aphorism of John Bunyan, "That which is last, lasts forever." That which is first, yields in due eason to the last; but nothing comes after the last. So that though ou are naturally darkness, when once you become light in the Lord, here is no evening to follow; "thy sun shall no more go down." The irst day in this life is an evening and a morning; but the second day, hen we shall be with God, forever, shall be a day with no evening, but ne, sacred, high, eternal noon.</p>

A glorious show made up of ransitory sun-beams and passing rain-drops, how can it abide? The races of the Christian character must not resemble the rainbow in its ransitory beauty, but, on the contrary, must be stablished, settled, biding. Seek, O believer, that every good thing you have may be an biding thing. May your character not be a writing upon the sand, but n inscription upon the rock! May your faith be no "baseless fabric of  vision," but may it be builded of material able to endure that awful ire which shall consume the wood, hay, and stubble of the hypocrite. ay you be rooted and grounded in love. May your convictions be deep, our love real, your desires earnest. May your whole life be so settled nd established, that all the blasts of hell, and all the storms of arth shall never be able to remove you. But notice how this blessing f being "stablished in the faith" is gained. The apostle's words point s to suffering as the means employed--"After that ye have suffered while." It is of no use to hope that we shall be well rooted if no ough winds pass over us. Those old gnarlings on the root of the oak ree, and those strange twistings of the branches, all tell of the many torms that have swept over it, and they are also indicators of the epth into which the roots have forced their way.

<p>Mark the union of the Three Divine Persons in all their gracious acts. ow unwisely do those believers talk who make preferences in the ersons of the Trinity; who think of Jesus as if he were the embodiment f everything lovely and gracious, while the Father they regard as everely just, but destitute of kindness. Equally wrong are those who agnify the decree of the Father, and the atonement of the Son, so as o depreciate the work of the Spirit. In deeds of grace none of the ersons of the Trinity act apart from the rest. They are as united in heir deeds as in their essence. In their love towards the chosen they re one, and in the actions which flow from that great central source hey are still undivided. Specially notice this in the matter of anctification. While we may without mistake speak of sanctification as he work of the Spirit, yet we must take heed that we do not view it as f the Father and the Son had no part therein. It is correct to speak f sanctification as the work of the Father, of the Son, and of the pirit. Still doth Jehovah say, "Let us make man in our own image after ur likeness," and thus we are "his workmanship, created in Christ esus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should alk in them." See the value which God sets upon real holiness, since he Three Persons in the Trinity are represented as co-working to roduce a Church without "spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." And ou, believer, as the follower of Christ, must also set a high value on oliness--upon purity of life and godliness of conversation. Value the lood of Christ as the foundation of your hope, but never speak isparagingly of the work of the Spirit which is your meetness for the nheritance of the saints in light. This day let us so live as to anifest the work of the Triune God in us.</p>

<p>God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry?</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Anger is not always or necessarily sinful, but it has such a tendency o run wild that whenever it displays itself, we should be quick to uestion its character, with this enquiry, "Doest thou well to be ngry?" It may be that we can answer, "YES." Very frequently anger is he madman's firebrand, but sometimes it is Elijah's fire from heaven. e do well when we are angry with sin, because of the wrong which it ommits against our good and gracious God; or with ourselves because we emain so foolish after so much divine instruction; or with others when he sole cause of anger is the evil which they do. He who is not angry t transgression becomes a partaker in it. Sin is a loathsome and ateful thing, and no renewed heart can patiently endure it. God imself is angry with the wicked every day, and it is written in His ord, "Ye that love the Lord, hate evil." Far more frequently it is to e feared that our anger is not commendable or even justifiable, and hen we must answer, "NO." Why should we be fretful with children, assionate with servants, and wrathful with companions? Is such anger onourable to our Christian profession, or glorifying to God? Is it not he old evil heart seeking to gain dominion, and should we not resist t with all the might of our newborn nature? Many professors give way o temper as though it were useless to attempt resistance; but let the eliever remember that he must be a conqueror in every point, or else e cannot be crowned. If we cannot control our tempers, what has grace one for us? Some one told Mr. Jay that grace was often grafted on a rab-stump. "Yes," said he, "but the fruit will not be crabs." We must ot make natural infirmity an excuse for sin, but we must fly to the ross and pray the Lord to crucify our tempers, and renew us in entleness and meekness after His own image.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any human speech to express the full meaning of his delightful phrase, "God is for me."

<div class="response">
<p>God's altar was to be built of unhewn stones, that no trace of human kill or labour might be seen upon it. Human wisdom delights to trim nd arrange the doctrines of the cross into a system more artificial nd more congenial with the depraved tastes of fallen nature; instead, owever, of improving the gospel carnal wisdom pollutes it, until it ecomes another gospel, and not the truth of God at all. All lterations and amendments of the Lord's own Word are defilements and ollutions. The proud heart of man is very anxious to have a hand in he justification of the soul before God; preparations for Christ are reamed of, humblings and repentings are trusted in, good works are ried up, natural ability is much vaunted, and by all means the attempt s made to lift up human tools upon the divine altar. It were well if inners would remember that so far from perfecting the Saviour's work, heir carnal confidences only pollute and dishonour it. The Lord alone ust be exalted in the work of atonement, and not a single mark of an's chisel or hammer will be endured. There is an inherent blasphemy n seeking to add to what Christ Jesus in His dying moments declared to e finished, or to improve that in which the Lord Jehovah finds perfect atisfaction. Trembling sinner, away with thy tools, and fall upon thy nees in humble supplication; and accept the Lord Jesus to be the altar f thine atonement, and rest in him alone.</p>
<p>Many professors may take warning from this morning's text as to the octrines which they believe. There is among Christians far too much nclination to square and reconcile the truths of revelation; this is a orm of irreverence and unbelief, let us strive against it, and receive ruth as we find it; rejoicing that the doctrines of the Word are nhewn stones, and so are all the more fit to build an altar for the ord.</p>

<p>Let us learn from Mary Magdalene how to obtain fellowship with the Lord esus. Notice how she sought. She sought the Saviour very early in the orning. If thou canst wait for Christ, and be patient in the hope of aving fellowship with him at some distant season, thou wilt never have ellowship at all; for the heart that is fitted for communion is a ungering and a thirsting heart. She sought him also with very great oldness. Other disciples fled from the sepulchre, for they trembled nd were amazed; but Mary, it is said, "stood" at the sepulchre. If you ould have Christ with you, seek him boldly. Let nothing hold you back. efy the world. Press on where others flee. She sought Christ aithfully--she stood at the sepulchre. Some find it hard to stand by a iving Saviour, but she stood by a dead one. Let us seek Christ after his mode, cleaving to the very least thing that has to do with him, emaining faithful though all others should forsake him. Note further, he sought Jesus earnestly--she stood "weeping". Those tear-droppings ere as spells that led the Saviour captive, and made him come forth nd show himself to her. If you desire Jesus' presence, weep after it! f you cannot be happy unless he come and say to you, "Thou art my eloved," you will soon hear his voice. Lastly, she sought the Saviour nly. What cared she for angels, she turned herself back from them; her earch was only for her Lord. If Christ be your one and only love, if our heart has cast out all rivals, you will not long lack the comfort f his presence. Mary Magdalene sought thus because she loved much. Let s arouse ourselves to the same intensity of affection; let our heart, ike Mary's, be full of Christ, and our love, like hers, will be atisfied with nothing short of himself. O Lord, reveal thyself to us his evening!</p>

<p>Keep the altar of private prayer burning. This is the very life of all iety. The sanctuary and family altars borrow their fires here, herefore let this burn well. Secret devotion is the very essence, vidence, and barometer, of vital and experimental religion.</p>

Let us suggest the Church, the inistry, your own soul, your children, your relations, your eighbours, your country, and the cause of God and truth throughout the orld. Let us examine ourselves on this important matter. Do we engage ith lukewarmness in private devotion? Is the fire of devotion burning imly in our hearts? Do the chariot wheels drag heavily? If so, let us e alarmed at this sign of decay. Let us go with weeping, and ask for he Spirit of grace and of supplications. Let us set apart special easons for extraordinary prayer. For if this fire should be smothered eneath the ashes of a worldly conformity, it will dim the fire on the amily altar, and lessen our influence both in the Church and in the orld.</p>
<p>The text will also apply to the altar of the heart. This is a golden ltar indeed. God loves to see the hearts of his people glowing towards imself. Let us give to God our hearts, all blazing with love, and seek is grace, that the fire may never be quenched; for it will not burn if he Lord does not keep it burning. Many foes will attempt to extinguish t; but if the unseen hand behind the wall pour thereon the sacred oil, t will blaze higher and higher. Let us use texts of Scripture as fuel or our heart's fire, they are live coals; let us attend sermons, but bove all, let us be much alone with Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus "appeared first to Mary Magdalene," probably not only on account f her great love and persevering seeking, but because, as the context ntimates,she had been a special trophy of Christ's delivering power. earn from this, that the greatness of our sin before conversion should ot make us imagine that we may not be specially favoured with the very ighest grade of fellowship. She was one who had left all to become a onstant attendant on the Saviour. He was her first, her chief object. any who were on Christ's side did not take up Christ's cross; she did. he spent her substance in relieving his wants. If we would see much of hrist, let us serve him. Tell me who they are that sit oftenest under he banner of his love, and drink deepest draughts from the cup of ommunion, and I am sure they will be those who give most, who serve est, and who abide closest to the bleeding heart of their dear Lord. ut notice how Christ revealed himself to this sorrowing one--by a ord, "Mary." It needed but one word in his voice, and at once she knew im, and her heart owned allegiance by another word, her heart was too ull to say more. That one word would naturally be the most fitting for he occasion. It implies obedience. She said, "Master." There is no tate of mind in which this confession of allegiance will be too cold. o, when your spirit glows most with the heavenly fire, then you will ay, "I am thy servant, thou hast loosed my bonds." If you can say, "Master," if you feel that his will is your will, then you stand in a appy, holy place. He must have said, "Mary," or else you could not ave said, "Rabboni." See, then, from all this, how Christ honours hose who honour him, how love draws our Beloved, how it needs but one ord of his to turn our weeping to rejoicing, how his presence makes he heart's sunshine.</p>

The only way in which he could omfort himself, was in the reflection that God would arise, and have ercy upon Zion: though he was sad, yet Zion should prosper; however ow his own estate, yet Zion should arise.

<p>The Lord our God hath shewed us his glory.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Deuteronomy</span> <span class="chapter">5</span>:<span class="verse">24</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>God's great design in all his works is the manifestation of his own lory. Any aim less than this were unworthy of himself. But how shall he glory of God be manifested to such fallen creatures as we are? an's eye is not single, he has ever a side glance towards his own onour, has too high an estimate of his own powers, and so is not ualified to behold the glory of the Lord. It is clear, then, that self ust stand out of the way, that there may be room for God to be xalted; and this is the reason why he bringeth his people ofttimes nto straits and difficulties, that, being made conscious of their own olly and weakness, they may be fitted to behold the majesty of God hen he comes forth to work their deliverance. He whose life is one ven and smooth path, will see but little of the glory of the Lord, for e has few occasions of self-emptying, and hence, but little fitness or being filled with the revelation of God. They who navigate little treams and shallow creeks, know but little of the God of tempests; but hey who "do business in great waters," these see his "wonders in the eep." Among the huge Atlantic-waves of bereavement, poverty, emptation, and reproach, we learn the power of Jehovah, because we eel the littleness of man. Thank God, then, if you have been led by a ough road: it is this which has given you your experience of God's reatness and lovingkindness. Your troubles have enriched you with a ealth of knowledge to be gained by no other means: your trials have een the cleft of the rock in which Jehovah has set you, as he did his ervant Moses, that you might behold his glory as it passed by. Praise od that you have not been left to the darkness and ignorance which ontinued prosperity might have involved, but that in the great fight f affliction, you have been capacitated for the outshinings of his lory in his wonderful dealings with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not uench.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Matthew</span> <span class="chapter">12</span>:<span class="verse">20</span></cite>

<div class="response">
<p>What is weaker than the bruised reed or the smoking flax? A reed that roweth in the fen or marsh, let but the wild duck light upon it, and t snaps; let but the foot of man brush against it, and it is bruised nd broken; every wind that flits across the river moves it to and fro. ou can conceive of nothing more frail or brittle, or whose existence s more in jeopardy, than a bruised reed. Then look at the smoking lax--what is it? It has a spark within it, it is true, but it is lmost smothered; an infant's breath might blow it out; nothing has a ore precarious existence than its flame. Weak things are here escribed, yet Jesus says of them, "The smoking flax I will not quench; he bruised reed I will not break." Some of God's children are made trong to do mighty works for him; God has his Samsons here and there ho can pull up Gaza's gates, and carry them to the top of the hill; he as a few mighties who are lion-like men, but the majority of his eople are a timid, trembling race. They are like starlings, frightened t every passer by; a little fearful flock. If temptation comes, they re taken like birds in a snare; if trial threatens, they are ready to aint; their frail skiff is tossed up and down by every wave, they are rifted along like a sea bird on the crest of the billows--weak things, ithout strength, without wisdom, without foresight. Yet, weak as they re, and because they are so weak, they have this promise made pecially to them. Herein is grace and graciousness! Herein is love and ovingkindness! How it opens to us the compassion of Jesus--so gentle, ender, considerate! We need never shrink back from his touch. We need ever fear a harsh word from him; though he might well chide us for our eakness, he rebuketh not. Bruised reeds shall have no blows from him, nd the smoking flax no damping frowns.</p>

<p>Oh! what enlightenment, what joys, what consolation, what delight of eart is experienced by that man who has learned to feed on Jesus, and n Jesus alone. Yet the realization which we have of Christ's reciousness is, in this life, imperfect at the best. As an old writer ays, "'Tis but a taste!" We have tasted "that the Lord is gracious," but we do not yet know how good and gracious he is, although what we now of his sweetness makes us long for more. We have enjoyed the irstfruits of the Spirit, and they have set us hungering and thirsting or the fulness of the heavenly vintage. We groan within ourselves, aiting for the adoption. Here we are like Israel in the wilderness, ho had but one cluster from Eshcol, there we shall be in the vineyard. ere we see the manna falling small, like coriander seed, but there hall we eat the bread of heaven and the old corn of the kingdom. We re but beginners now in spiritual education; for although we have earned the first letters of the alphabet, we cannot read words yet, uch less can we put sentences together; but as one says, "He that has een in heaven but five minutes, knows more than the general assembly f divines on earth." We have many ungratified desires at present, but oon every wish shall be satisfied; and all our powers shall find the weetest employment in that eternal world of joy. O Christian, antedate eaven for a few years. Within a very little time thou shalt be rid of ll thy trials and thy troubles. Thine eyes now suffused with tears hall weep no longer. Thou shalt gaze in ineffable rapture upon the plendour of him who sits upon the throne. Nay, more, upon his throne halt thou sit. The triumph of his glory shall be shared by thee; his rown, his joy, his paradise, these shall be thine, and thou shalt be o-heir with him who is the heir of all things.</p>

Yet they broke down he hedges with which God had enclosed them as a sacred garden; they orsook their own true and living God, and followed after false gods. onstantly did the Lord reprove them for this infatuation, and our text ontains one instance of God's expostulating with them, "What hast thou o do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of the muddy iver?"--for so it may be translated. "Why dost thou wander afar and eave thine own cool stream from Lebanon? Why dost thou forsake erusalem to turn aside to Noph and to Tahapanes? Why art thou so trangely set on mischief, that thou canst not be content with the good nd healthful, but wouldst follow after that which is evil and eceitful?" Is there not here a word of expostulation and warning to he Christian? O true believer, called by grace and washed in the recious blood of Jesus, thou hast tasted of better drink than the uddy river of this world's pleasure can give thee; thou hast had ellowship with Christ; thou hast obtained the joy of seeing Jesus, and eaning thine head upon his bosom.

Good utherford once said, "I have tasted of Christ's own manna, and it hath ut my mouth out of taste for the brown bread of this world's joys." Methinks it should be so with thee. If thou art wandering after the aters of Egypt, O return quickly to the one living fountain: the aters of Sihor may be sweet to the Egyptians, but they will prove only itterness to thee. What hast thou to do with them? Jesus asks thee his question this evening--what wilt thou answer him?</p>

<p>Christ Jesus is joined unto his people in marriage-union. In love he spoused his Church as a chaste virgin, long before she fell under the oke of bondage. Full of burning affection he toiled, like Jacob for achel, until the whole of her purchase-money had been paid, and now, aving sought her by his Spirit, and brought her to know and love him, e awaits the glorious hour when their mutual bliss shall be onsummated at the marriage-supper of the Lamb. Not yet hath the lorious Bridegroom presented his betrothed, perfected and complete, efore the Majesty of heaven; not yet hath she actually entered upon he enjoyment of her dignities as his wife and queen: she is as yet a anderer in a world of woe, a dweller in the tents of Kedar; but she is ven now the bride, the spouse of Jesus, dear to his heart, precious in is sight, written on his hands, and united with his person. On earth e exercises towards her all the affectionate offices of Husband. He akes rich provision for her wants, pays all her debts, allows her to ssume his name, and to share in all his wealth. Nor will he ever act therwise to her. The word divorce he will never mention, for "He ateth putting away." Death must sever the conjugal tie between the ost loving mortals, but it cannot divide the links of this immortal arriage. In heaven they marry not, but are as the angels of God; yet here is this one marvellous exception to the rule, for in Heaven hrist and his Church shall celebrate their joyous nuptials. This ffinity as it is more lasting, so is it more near than earthly edlock. Let the love of husband be never so pure and fervent, it is ut a faint picture of the flame which burns in the heart of Jesus. assing all human union is that mystical cleaving unto the Church, for hich Christ left his Father, and became one flesh with her.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Our spiritual privileges are of the highest order. "Among princes" is he place of select society. "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, nd with his Son Jesus Christ." Speak of select society, there is none ike this! "We are a chosen generation, a peculiar people, a royal riesthood." "We are come unto the general assembly and church of the irst-born, whose names are written in heaven." The saints have courtly udience: princes have admittance to royalty when common people must tand afar off. The child of God has free access to the inner courts of eaven. "For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the ather." "Let us come boldly," says the apostle, "to the throne of the eavenly grace." Among princes there is abundant wealth, but what is he abundance of princes compared with the riches of believers? for "all things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's." "He hat spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall e not with him also freely give us all things?" Princes have peculiar ower. A prince of heaven's empire has great influence: he wields a ceptre in his own domain; he sits upon Jesus' throne, for "He hath ade us kings and priests unto God, and we shall reign forever and ver." We reign over the united kingdom of time and eternity. Princes, gain, have special honour. We may look down upon all earth-born ignity from the eminence upon which grace has placed us. For what is uman grandeur to this, "He hath raised us up together, and made us sit ogether in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"? We share the honour of hrist, and compared with this, earthly splendours are not worth a hought. Communion with Jesus is a richer gem than ever glittered in mperial diadem. Union with the Lord is a coronet of beauty outshining ll the blaze of imperial pomp.</p>

<p>Exceeding great and precious promises.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">2 Peter</span> <span class="chapter">1</span>:<span class="verse">4</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>If you would know experimentally the preciousness of the promises, and njoy them in your own heart, meditate much upon them. There are romises which are like grapes in the wine-press; if you will tread hem the juice will flow. Thinking over the hallowed words will often e the prelude to their fulfilment. While you are musing upon them, the oon which you are seeking will insensibly come to you. Many a hristian who has thirsted for the promise has found the favour which t ensured gently distilling into his soul even while he has been onsidering the divine record; and he has rejoiced that ever he was led o lay the promise near his heart.</p>
<p>But besides meditating upon the promises, seek in thy soul to receive hem as being the very words of God. Speak to thy soul thus, "If I were ealing with a man's promise, I should carefully consider the ability nd the character of the man who had covenanted with me. So with the romise of God; my eye must not be so much fixed upon the greatness of he mercy--that may stagger me; as upon the greatness of the romiser--that will cheer me. My soul, it is God, even thy God, God hat cannot lie, who speaks to thee. This word of his which thou art ow considering is as true as his own existence. He is a God nchangeable. He has not altered the thing which has gone out of his outh, nor called back one single consolatory sentence. Nor doth he ack any power; it is the God that made the heavens and the earth who as spoken thus. Nor can he fail in wisdom as to the time when he will estow the favours, for he knoweth when it is best to give and when etter to withhold. Therefore, seeing that it is the word of a God so rue, so immutable, so powerful, so wise, I will and must believe the romise." If we thus meditate upon the promises, and consider the romiser, we shall experience their sweetness, and obtain their ulfilment.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Most blessed challenge! How unanswerable it is! Every sin of the elect as laid upon the great Champion of our salvation, and by the atonement arried away. There is no sin in God's book against his people: he eeth no sin in Jacob, neither iniquity in Israel; they are justified n Christ forever. When the guilt of sin was taken away, the punishment f sin was removed. For the Christian there is no stroke from God's ngry hand--nay, not so much as a single frown of punitive justice. The eliever may be chastised by his Father, but God the Judge has nothing o say to the Christian, except "I have absolved thee: thou art cquitted." For the Christian there is no penal death in this world, uch less any second death. He is completely freed from all the unishment as well as the guilt of sin, and the power of sin is removed oo. It may stand in our way, and agitate us with perpetual warfare; ut sin is a conquered foe to every soul in union with Jesus. There is o sin which a Christian cannot overcome if he will only rely upon his od to do it. They who wear the white robe in heaven overcame through he blood of the Lamb, and we may do the same. No lust is too mighty, o besetting sin too strongly entrenched; we can overcome through the ower of Christ. Do believe it, Christian, that thy sin is a condemned hing. It may kick and struggle, but it is doomed to die. God has ritten condemnation across its brow. Christ has crucified it, "nailing t to his cross." Go now and mortify it, and the Lord help you to live o his praise, for sin with all its guilt, shame, and fear, is gone.</p>
<p>"Here's pardon for transgressions past,</p>

<p>So foolish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Psalm</span> <span class="chapter">73</span>:<span class="verse">22</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Remember this is the confession of the man after God's own heart; and n telling us his inner life, he writes, "So foolish was I, and gnorant." The word "foolish," here, means more than it signifies in rdinary language. David, in a former verse of the Psalm, writes, "I as envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked," which shows that the folly he intended had sin in it. He puts himself own as being thus "foolish," and adds a word which is to give ntensity to it; "so foolish was I." How foolish he could not tell. It as a sinful folly, a folly which was not to be excused by frailty, but o be condemned because of its perverseness and wilful ignorance, for e had been envious of the present prosperity of the ungodly, forgetful f the dreadful end awaiting all such. And are we better than David hat we should call ourselves wise! Do we profess that we have attained erfection, or to have been so chastened that the rod has taken all our ilfulness out of us? Ah, this were pride indeed! If David was foolish, ow foolish should we be in our own esteem if we could but see urselves! Look back, believer: think of your doubting God when he has een so faithful to you--think of your foolish outcry of "Not so, my ather," when he crossed his hands in affliction to give you the larger lessing; think of the many times when you have read his providences in he dark, misinterpreted his dispensations, and groaned out, "All these hings are against me," when they are all working together for your ood! Think how often you have chosen sin because of its pleasure, when ndeed, that pleasure was a root of bitterness to you! Surely if we now our own heart we must plead guilty to the indictment of a sinful olly; and conscious of this "foolishness," we must make David's onsequent resolve our own--"Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel."</p>

<p>Who went about doing good.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Few words, but yet an exquisite miniature of the Lord Jesus Christ. here are not many touches, but they are the strokes of a master's encil. Of the Saviour and only of the Saviour is it true in the ullest, broadest, and most unqualified sense. "He went about doing ood." From this description it is evident that he did good personally. he evangelists constantly tell us that he touched the leper with his wn finger, that he anointed the eyes of the blind, and that in cases here he was asked to speak the word only at a distance, he did not sually comply, but went himself to the sick bed, and there personally rought the cure. A lesson to us, if we would do good, to do it urselves. Give alms with your own hand; a kind look, or word, will nhance the value of the gift. Speak to a friend about his soul; your oving appeal will have more influence than a whole library of tracts. ur Lord's mode of doing good sets forth his incessant activity! He did ot only the good which came close to hand, but he "went about" on his rrands of mercy. Throughout the whole land of Judea there was scarcely  village or a hamlet which was not gladdened by the sight of him. How his reproves the creeping, loitering manner, in which many professors erve the Lord. Let us gird up the loins of our mind, and be not weary n well doing. Does not the text imply that Jesus Christ went out of is way to do good? "He went about doing good." He was never deterred y danger or difficulty. He sought out the objects of his gracious ntentions. So must we. If old plans will not answer, we must try new nes, for fresh experiments sometimes achieve more than regular ethods. Christ's perseverance, and the unity of his purpose, are also inted at, and the practical application of the subject may be summed p in the words, "He hath left us an example that we should follow in is steps."</p>

We, like Peter, emember our boastful promise: "Though all men shall forsake thee, yet ill not I." We eat our own words with the bitter herbs of repentance. hen we think of what we vowed we would be, and of what we have been, e may weep whole showers of grief.

Can we, when we are reminded of our sins, and heir exceeding sinfulness, remain stolid and stubborn? Will we not ake our house a Bochim, and cry unto the Lord for renewed assurances f pardoning love? May we never take a dry-eyed look at sin, lest ere ong we have a tongue parched in the flames of hell. Peter also thought pon his Master's look of love. The Lord followed up the cock's warning oice with an admonitory look of sorrow, pity, and love. That glance as never out of Peter's mind so long as he lived. It was far more ffectual than ten thousand sermons would have been without the Spirit. he penitent apostle would be sure to weep when he recollected the aviour's full forgiveness, which restored him to his former place.

Yet as the sun on summer days gladdens us with beams ore warm and bright than at other times, and as rivers are at certain easons swollen by the rain, and as the atmosphere itself is sometimes raught with more fresh, more bracing, or more balmy influences than eretofore, so is it with the mercy of God; it hath its golden hours; ts days of overflow, when the Lord magnifieth his grace before the ons of men. Amongst the blessings of the nether springs, the joyous ays of harvest are a special season of excessive favour. It is the lory of autumn that the ripe gifts of providence are then abundantly estowed; it is the mellow season of realization, whereas all before as but hope and expectation. Great is the joy of harvest. Happy are he reapers who fill their arms with the liberality of heaven. The salmist tells us that the harvest is the crowning of the year. Surely hese crowning mercies call for crowning thanksgiving! Let us render it y the inward emotions of gratitude. Let our hearts be warmed; let our pirits remember, meditate, and think upon this goodness of the Lord. hen let us praise him with our lips, and laud and magnify his name rom whose bounty all this goodness flows. Let us glorify God by ielding our gifts to his cause. A practical proof of our gratitude is  special thank-offering to the Lord of the harvest.</p>

<p>Let me learn from Ruth, the gleaner. As she went out to gather the ears f corn, so must I go forth into the fields of prayer, meditation, the rdinances, and hearing the word to gather spiritual food. The gleaner athers her portion ear by ear; her gains are little by little: so must  be content to search for single truths, if there be no greater plenty f them. Every ear helps to make a bundle, and every gospel lesson ssists in making us wise unto salvation. The gleaner keeps her eyes pen: if she stumbled among the stubble in a dream, she would have no oad to carry home rejoicingly at eventide. I must be watchful in eligious exercises lest they become unprofitable to me; I fear I have ost much already--O that I may rightly estimate my opportunities, and lean with greater diligence. The gleaner stoops for all she finds, and o must I. High spirits criticize and object, but lowly minds glean and eceive benefit. A humble heart is a great help towards profitably earing the gospel. The engrafted soul-saving word is not received xcept with meekness. A stiff back makes a bad gleaner; down, master ride, thou art a vile robber, not to be endured for a moment. What the leaner gathers she holds: if she dropped one ear to find another, the esult of her day's work would be but scant; she is as careful to etain as to obtain, and so at last her gains are great. How often do I orget all that I hear; the second truth pushes the first out of my ead, and so my reading and hearing end in much ado about nothing! Do I eel duly the importance of storing up the truth? A hungry belly makes he gleaner wise; if there be no corn in her hand, there will be no read on her table; she labours under the sense of necessity, and hence er tread is nimble and her grasp is firm; I have even a greater ecessity, Lord, help me to feel it, that it may urge me onward to lean in fields which yield so plenteous a reward to diligence.</p>

Light is also the emblem of knowledge. n heaven our knowledge will be perfect, but the Lord Jesus himself ill be the fountain of it.

<p>Every believer understands that to know God is the highest and best orm of knowledge; and this spiritual knowledge is a source of strength o the Christian. It strengthens his faith. Believers are constantly poken of in the Scriptures as being persons who are enlightened and aught of the Lord; they are said to "have an unction from the Holy ne," and it is the Spirit's peculiar office to lead them into all ruth, and all this for the increase and the fostering of their faith. nowledge strengthens love, as well as faith. Knowledge opens the door, nd then through that door we see our Saviour. Or, to use another imilitude, knowledge paints the portrait of Jesus, and when we see hat portrait then we love him, we cannot love a Christ whom we do not now, at least, in some degree. If we know but little of the xcellences of Jesus, what he has done for us, and what he is doing ow, we cannot love him much; but the more we know him, the more we hall love him. Knowledge also strengthens hope. How can we hope for a hing if we do not know of its existence? Hope may be the telescope, ut till we receive instruction, our ignorance stands in the front of he glass, and we can see nothing whatever; knowledge removes the nterposing object, and when we look through the bright optic glass we iscern the glory to be revealed, and anticipate it with joyous onfidence. Knowledge supplies us reasons for patience. How shall we ave patience unless we know something of the sympathy of Christ, and nderstand the good which is to come out of the correction which our eavenly Father sends us? Nor is there one single grace of the hristian which, under God, will not be fostered and brought to erfection by holy knowledge. How important, then, is it that we should row not only in grace, but in the "knowledge" of our Lord and Saviour esus Christ.</p>

Infinite mercy pares the food of men, but in view of the active agents which are eady to destroy the harvest, right wisely are we taught to pray, "Give s this day our daily bread."

We learn from this our dependence upon the Lord, and the need f prayer that no blight may fall upon our work. Spiritual pride or loth will soon bring upon us the dreadful evil, and only the Lord of he harvest can remove it. Mildew may even attack our own hearts, and hrivel our prayers and religious exercises. May it please the great usbandman to avert so serious a calamity.

He looks over the raging waters nd sees the spirit of Jesus treading the billows, and he hears a voice aying, "It is I, be not afraid." He knows too that God is always wise, nd, knowing this, he is confident that there can be no accidents, no istakes; that nothing can occur which ought not to arise. He can say, "If I should lose all I have, it is better that I should lose than ave, if God so wills: the worst calamity is the wisest and the kindest hing that could befall to me if God ordains it." "We know that all hings work together for good to them that love God." The Christian oes not merely hold this as a theory, but he knows it as a matter of act. Everything has worked for good as yet; the poisonous drugs mixed n fit proportions have worked the cure; the sharp cuts of the lancet ave cleansed out the proud flesh and facilitated the healing.

It is written, and nothing can blot out he sentence, "The upright love thee."

Is ot a deceiver's religion equally wonderful? How does he make so arefaced a lie appear to be a truth? How can he make his tinsel answer o well the purpose of gold? A spider's web comes all from the reature's own bowels. The bee gathers her wax from flowers, the spider ucks no flowers, and yet she spins out her material to any length. ven so hypocrites find their trust and hope within themselves; their nchor was forged on their own anvil, and their cable twisted by their wn hands.

This is  mistake, for "all things are possible to him that believeth"; and it s possible for us to mount into a state in which a doubt or a fear hall be but as a bird of passage flitting across the soul, but never ingering there. When you read of the high and sweet communions enjoyed y favoured saints, you sigh and murmur in the chamber of your heart, "Alas! these are not for me." O climber, if thou hast but faith, thou halt yet stand upon the sunny pinnacle of the temple, for "all things re possible to him that believeth." You hear of exploits which holy en have done for Jesus; what they have enjoyed of him; how much they ave been like him; how they have been able to endure great ersecutions for his sake; and you say, "Ah! as for me, I am but a orm; I can never attain to this." But there is nothing which one saint as, that you may not be. There is no elevation of grace, no attainment f spirituality, no clearness of assurance, no post of duty, which is ot open to you if you have but the power to believe. Lay aside your ackcloth and ashes, and rise to the dignity of your true position; you re little in Israel because you will be so, not because there is any ecessity for it. It is not meet that thou shouldst grovel in the dust,  child of a King. Ascend! The golden throne of assurance is waiting or you! The crown of communion with Jesus is ready to bedeck your row. Wrap yourself in scarlet and fine linen, and fare sumptuously very day; for if thou believest, thou mayst eat the fat of kidneys of heat; thy land shall flow with milk and honey, and thy soul shall be atisfied as with marrow and fatness. Gather golden sheaves of grace, or they await thee in the fields of faith. "All things are possible to im that believeth."</p>

They need no ocial relationship to minister comfort, and whatever happiness they ay derive from association with their fellows is not essential to heir bliss, for their Lord's society is enough for their largest esires.

<p>Mary of Magdala was the victim of a fearful evil. She was possessed by ot one devil only, but seven. These dreadful inmates caused much pain nd pollution to the poor frame in which they had found a lodging. Hers as a hopeless, horrible case. She could not help herself, neither ould any human succour avail. But Jesus passed that way, and unsought, nd probably even resisted by the poor demoniac, he uttered the word of ower, and Mary of Magdala became a trophy of the healing power of esus. All the seven demons left her, left her never to return, orcibly ejected by the Lord of all. What a blessed deliverance! What a appy change! From delirium to delight, from despair to peace, from ell to heaven! Straightway she became a constant follower of Jesus, atching his every word, following his devious steps, sharing his oilsome life; and withal she became his generous helper, first among hat band of healed and grateful women who ministered unto him of their ubstance. When Jesus was lifted up in crucifixion, Mary remained the harer of his shame: we find her first beholding from afar, and then rawing near to the foot of the cross. She could not die on the cross ith Jesus, but she stood as near it as she could, and when his blessed ody was taken down, she watched to see how and where it was laid. She as the faithful and watchful believer, last at the sepulchre where esus slept, first at the grave whence he arose. Her holy fidelity made er a favoured beholder of her beloved Rabboni, who deigned to call her y her name, and to make her his messenger of good news to the rembling disciples and Peter. Thus grace found her a maniac and made er a minister, cast out devils and gave her to behold angels, elivered her from Satan, and united her forever to the Lord Jesus. May  also be such a miracle of grace!</p>

Christ is the sustenance of our life. What can the Christian eed upon but Jesus' flesh and blood? "This is the bread which cometh own from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die." O wayworn ilgrims in this wilderness of sin, you never get a morsel to satisfy he hunger of your spirits, except ye find it in him! Christ is the olace of our life. All our true joys come from him; and in times of rouble, his presence is our consolation. There is nothing worth living or but him; and his lovingkindness is better than life! Christ is the bject of our life. As speeds the ship towards the port, so hastes the eliever towards the haven of his Saviour's bosom.

<p>Numbers of Christians can view the past with pleasure, but regard the resent with dissatisfaction; they look back upon the days which they ave passed in communing with the Lord as being the sweetest and the est they have ever known, but as to the present, it is clad in a sable arb of gloom and dreariness. Once they lived near to Jesus, but now hey feel that they have wandered from him, and they say, "O that I ere as in months past!" They complain that they have lost their vidences, or that they have not present peace of mind, or that they ave no enjoyment in the means of grace, or that conscience is not so ender, or that they have not so much zeal for God's glory. The causes f this mournful state of things are manifold. It may arise through a omparative neglect of prayer, for a neglected closet is the beginning f all spiritual decline. Or it may be the result of idolatry. The eart has been occupied with something else, more than with God; the ffections have been set on the things of earth, instead of the things f heaven. A jealous God will not be content with a divided heart; he ust be loved first and best. He will withdraw the sunshine of his resence from a cold, wandering heart. Or the cause may be found in elf-confidence and self-righteousness. Pride is busy in the heart, and elf is exalted instead of lying low at the foot of the cross. hristian, if you are not now as you "were in months past," do not rest atisfied with wishing for a return of former happiness, but go at once o seek your Master, and tell him your sad state. Ask his grace and trength to help you to walk more closely with him; humble yourself efore him, and he will lift you up, and give you yet again to enjoy he light of his countenance. Do not sit down to sigh and lament; while he beloved Physician lives there is hope, nay there is a certainty of ecovery for the worst cases.</p>

<p>"the consolation of Israel." "Everlasting consolation"--here is the ream of all, for the eternity of comfort is the crown and glory of it. hat is this "everlasting consolation"? It includes a sense of pardoned in. A Christian man has received in his heart the witness of the pirit that his iniquities are put away like a cloud, and his ransgressions like a thick cloud. If sin be pardoned, is not that an verlasting consolation? Next, the Lord gives his people an abiding ense of acceptance in Christ. The Christian knows that God looks upon im as standing in union with Jesus. Union to the risen Lord is a onsolation of the most abiding order; it is, in fact, everlasting. Let ickness prostrate us, have we not seen hundreds of believers as happy n the weakness of disease as they would have been in the strength of ale and blooming health? Let death's arrows pierce us to the heart, ur comfort dies not, for have not our ears full often heard the songs f saints as they have rejoiced because the living love of God was shed broad in their hearts in dying moments? Yes, a sense of acceptance in he Beloved is an everlasting consolation. Moreover, the Christian has  conviction of his security. God has promised to save those who trust n Christ: the Christian does trust in Christ, and he believes that God ill be as good as his word, and will save him. He feels that he is afe by virtue of his being bound up with the person and work of Jesus.</p>

<p>The rainbow, the symbol of the covenant with Noah, is typical of our ord Jesus, who is the Lord's witness to the people. When may we expect o see the token of the covenant? The rainbow is only to be seen ainted upon a cloud. When the sinner's conscience is dark with clouds, hen he remembers his past sin, and mourneth and lamenteth before God, esus Christ is revealed to him as the covenant Rainbow, displaying all he glorious hues of the divine character and betokening peace. To the eliever, when his trials and temptations surround him, it is sweet to ehold the person of our Lord Jesus Christ--to see him bleeding, iving, rising, and pleading for us. God's rainbow is hung over the loud of our sins, our sorrows, and our woes, to prophesy deliverance. or does a cloud alone give a rainbow, there must be the crystal drops o reflect the light of the sun. So, our sorrows must not only hreaten, but they must really fall upon us. There had been no Christ or us if the vengeance of God had been merely a threatening cloud: unishment must fall in terrible drops upon the Surety. Until there is  real anguish in the sinner's conscience, there is no Christ for him; ntil the chastisement which he feels becomes grievous, he cannot see esus. But there must also be a sun; for clouds and drops of rain make ot rainbows unless the sun shineth. Beloved, our God, who is as the un to us, always shines, but we do not always see him--clouds hide his ace; but no matter what drops may be falling, or what clouds may be hreatening, if he does but shine there will be a rainbow at once. It s said that when we see the rainbow the shower is over. Certain it is, hat when Christ comes, our troubles remove; when we behold Jesus, our ins vanish, and our doubts and fears subside.

<p>The cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Psalm</span> <span class="chapter">104</span>:<span class="verse">16</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Lebanon's cedars are emblematic of the Christian, in that they owe heir planting entirely to the Lord. This is quite true of every child f God. He is not man-planted, nor self-planted, but God-planted. The ysterious hand of the divine Spirit dropped the living seed into a eart which he had himself prepared for its reception. Every true heir f heaven owns the great Husbandman as his planter. Moreover, the edars of Lebanon are not dependent upon man for their watering; they tand on the lofty rock, unmoistened by human irrigation; and yet our eavenly Father supplieth them. Thus it is with the Christian who has earned to live by faith. He is independent of man, even in temporal hings; for his continued maintenance he looks to the Lord his God, and o him alone. The dew of heaven is his portion, and the God of heaven s his fountain. Again, the cedars of Lebanon are not protected by any ortal power. They owe nothing to man for their preservation from tormy wind and tempest. They are God's trees, kept and preserved by im, and by him alone. It is precisely the same with the Christian. He s not a hot-house plant, sheltered from temptation; he stands in the ost exposed position; he has no shelter, no protection, except this, hat the broad wings of the eternal God always cover the cedars which e himself has planted. Like cedars, believers are full of sap, having itality enough to be ever green, even amid winter's snows. Lastly, the lourishing and majestic condition of the cedar is to the praise of God nly. The Lord, even the Lord alone hath been everything unto the edars, and, therefore David very sweetly puts it in one of the psalms, "Praise ye the Lord, fruitful trees and all cedars." In the believer here is nothing that can magnify man; he is planted, nourished, and rotected by the Lord's own hand, and to him let all the glory be scribed.</p>

"The bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, hat I may remember the everlasting covenant." Oh! it is not my emembering God, it is God's remembering me which is the ground of my afety; it is not my laying hold of his covenant, but his covenant's aying hold on me. Glory be to God! the whole of the bulwarks of alvation are secured by divine power, and even the minor towers, which e may imagine might have been left to man, are guarded by almighty trength. Even the remembrance of the covenant is not left to our emories, for we might forget, but our Lord cannot forget the saints hom he has graven on the palms of his hands. It is with us as with srael in Egypt; the blood was upon the lintel and the two side-posts, ut the Lord did not say, "When you see the blood I will pass over ou," but "When I see the blood I will pass over you." My looking to esus brings me joy and peace, but it is God's looking to Jesus which ecures my salvation and that of all his elect, since it is impossible or our God to look at Christ, our bleeding Surety, and then to be ngry with us for sins already punished in him. No, it is not left with s even to be saved by remembering the covenant. There is no insey-wolsey here--not a single thread of the creature mars the abric. It is not of man, neither by man, but of the Lord alone. We hould remember the covenant, and we shall do it, through divine grace; ut the hinge of our safety does not hang there--it is God's emembering us, not our remembering him; and hence the covenant is an verlasting covenant.</p>

"I beseech you therefore, by the mercies of God, that ye present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our reasonable service." Let not your zeal evaporate in some little bullition of song. Show your love in expressive tokens. Love the rethren of him who loved you.

If there be a poor tried eliever, weep with him, and bear his cross for the sake of him who ept for thee and carried thy sins. Since thou art thus forgiven freely or Christ's sake, go and tell to others the joyful news of pardoning ercy.

<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Ezekiel</span> <span class="chapter">36</span>:<span class="verse">26</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>A heart of flesh is known by its tenderness concerning sin. To have ndulged a foul imagination, or to have allowed a wild desire to tarry ven for a moment, is quite enough to make a heart of flesh grieve efore the Lord. The heart of stone calls a great iniquity nothing, but ot so the heart of flesh.</p>
<p>"If to the right or left I stray,</p>
<p>That moment, Lord, reprove;</p>
<p>And let me weep my life away,</p>
<p>For having grieved thy love"</p>
<p>The heart of flesh is tender of God's will. My Lord Will-be-will is a reat blusterer, and it is hard to subject him to God's will; but when he heart of flesh is given, the will quivers like an aspen leaf in very breath of heaven, and bows like an osier in every breeze of God's pirit. The natural will is cold, hard iron, which is not to be ammered into form, but the renewed will, like molten metal, is soon oulded by the hand of grace. In the fleshy heart there is a tenderness f the affections. The hard heart does not love the Redeemer, but the enewed heart burns with affection towards him. The hard heart is elfish and coldly demands, "Why should I weep for sin? Why should I ove the Lord?" But the heart of flesh says; "Lord, thou knowest that I ove thee; help me to love thee more!" Many are the privileges of this enewed heart; "'Tis here the Spirit dwells, 'tis here that Jesus ests." It is fitted to receive every spiritual blessing, and every lessing comes to it. It is prepared to yield every heavenly fruit to he honour and praise of God, and therefore the Lord delights in it. A ender heart is the best defence against sin, and the best preparation or heaven. A renewed heart stands on its watchtower looking for the oming of the Lord Jesus. Have you this heart of flesh?</p>

<p>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Psalm</span> <span class="chapter">29</span>:<span class="verse">2</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>God's glory is the result of his nature and acts. He is glorious in his haracter, for there is such a store of everything that is holy, and ood, and lovely in God, that he must be glorious. The actions which low from his character are also glorious; but while he intends that hey should manifest to his creatures his goodness, and mercy, and ustice, he is equally concerned that the glory associated with them hould be given only to himself. Nor is there aught in ourselves in hich we may glory; for who maketh us to differ from another? And what ave we that we did not receive from the God of all grace? Then how areful ought we to be to walk humbly before the Lord! The moment we lorify ourselves, since there is room for one glory only in the niverse, we set ourselves up as rivals to the Most High. Shall the nsect of an hour glorify itself against the sun which warmed it into ife? Shall the potsherd exalt itself above the man who fashioned it pon the wheel? Shall the dust of the desert strive with the whirlwind? r the drops of the ocean struggle with the tempest? Give unto the ord, all ye righteous, give unto the Lord glory and strength; give nto him the honour that is due unto his name. Yet it is, perhaps, one f the hardest struggles of the Christian life to learn this entence--"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be glory." It is  lesson which God is ever teaching us, and teaching us sometimes by ost painful discipline. Let a Christian begin to boast, "I can do all hings," without adding "through Christ which strengtheneth me," and efore long he will have to groan, "I can do nothing," and bemoan imself in the dust. When we do anything for the Lord, and he is leased to accept of our doings, let us lay our crown at his feet, and xclaim, "Not I, but the grace of God which was with me!"</p>

<p>Present possession is declared. At this present moment we have the irst fruits of the Spirit. We have repentance, that gem of the first ater; faith, that priceless pearl; hope, the heavenly emerald; and ove, the glorious ruby. We are already made "new creatures in Christ esus," by the effectual working of God the Holy Ghost. This is called he firstfruit because it comes first. As the wave-sheaf was the first f the harvest, so the spiritual life, and all the graces which adorn hat life, are the first operations of the Spirit of God in our souls. he firstfruits were the pledge of the harvest. As soon as the sraelite had plucked the first handful of ripe ears, he looked forward ith glad anticipation to the time when the wain should creak beneath he sheaves. So, brethren, when God gives us things which are pure, ovely, and of good report, as the work of the Holy Spirit, these are o us the prognostics of the coming glory. The firstfruits were always oly to the Lord, and our new nature, with all its powers, is a onsecrated thing. The new life is not ours that we should ascribe its xcellence to our own merit; it is Christ's image and creation, and is rdained for his glory. But the firstfruits were not the harvest, and he works of the Spirit in us at this moment are not the onsummation--the perfection is yet to come. We must not boast that we ave attained, and so reckon the wave-sheaf to be all the produce of he year: we must hunger and thirst after righteousness, and pant for he day of full redemption. Dear reader, this evening open your mouth ide, and God will fill it. Let the boon in present possession excite n you a sacred avarice for more grace. Groan within yourself for igher degrees of consecration, and your Lord will grant them to you, or he is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we ask or even hink.</p>

<p>The mercy of God.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Psalm</span> <span class="chapter">52</span>:<span class="verse">8</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Meditate a little on this mercy of the Lord. It is tender mercy. With entle, loving touch, he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up heir wounds. He is as gracious in the manner of his mercy as in the atter of it. It is great mercy. There is nothing little in God; his ercy is like himself--it is infinite. You cannot measure it. His mercy s so great that it forgives great sins to great sinners, after great engths of time, and then gives great favours and great privileges, and aises us up to great enjoyments in the great heaven of the great God. t is undeserved mercy, as indeed all true mercy must be, for deserved ercy is only a misnomer for justice. There was no right on the inner's part to the kind consideration of the Most High; had the rebel een doomed at once to eternal fire he would have richly merited the oom, and if delivered from wrath, sovereign love alone has found a ause, for there was none in the sinner himself. It is rich mercy. Some hings are great, but have little efficacy in them, but this mercy is a ordial to your drooping spirits; a golden ointment to your bleeding ounds; a heavenly bandage to your broken bones; a royal chariot for our weary feet; a bosom of love for your trembling heart. It is anifold mercy. As Bunyan says, "All the flowers in God's garden are ouble." There is no single mercy. You may think you have but one ercy, but you shall find it to be a whole cluster of mercies. It is bounding mercy. Millions have received it, yet far from its being xhausted; it is as fresh, as full, and as free as ever. It is nfailing mercy. It will never leave thee. If mercy be thy friend, ercy will be with thee in temptation to keep thee from yielding; with hee in trouble to prevent thee from sinking; with thee living to be he light and life of thy countenance; and with thee dying to be the oy of thy soul when earthly comfort is ebbing fast.</p>

<p>This sickness is not unto death.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">John</span> <span class="chapter">11</span>:<span class="verse">4</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>From our Lord's words we learn that there is a limit to sickness. Here s an "unto" within which its ultimate end is restrained, and beyond hich it cannot go. Lazarus might pass through death, but death was not o be the ultimatum of his sickness. In all sickness, the Lord saith to he waves of pain, "Hitherto shall ye go, but no further." His fixed urpose is not the destruction, but the instruction of his people. isdom hangs up the thermometer at the furnace mouth, and regulates the eat.</p>
<p>1. The limit is encouragingly comprehensive. The God of providence has imited the time, manner, intensity, repetition, and effects of all our icknesses; each throb is decreed, each sleepless hour predestinated, ach relapse ordained, each depression of spirit foreknown, and each anctifying result eternally purposed. Nothing great or small escapes he ordaining hand of him who numbers the hairs of our head.</p>
<p>2. This limit is wisely adjusted to our strength, to the end designed, nd to the grace apportioned. Affliction comes not at haphazard--the eight of every stroke of the rod is accurately measured. He who made o mistakes in balancing the clouds and meting out the heavens, commits o errors in measuring out the ingredients which compose the medicine f souls. We cannot suffer too much nor be relieved too late.</p>
<p>3. The limit is tenderly appointed. The knife of the heavenly Surgeon ever cuts deeper than is absolutely necessary. "He doth not afflict illingly, nor grieve the children of men." A mother's heart cries, "Spare my child;" but no mother is more compassionate than our gracious od. When we consider how hard-mouthed we are, it is a wonder that we re not driven with a sharper bit. The thought is full of consolation, hat he who has fixed the bounds of our habitation, has also fixed the ounds of our tribulation.</p>

<p>A golden truth is couched in the fact that the Saviour put the myrrhed ine-cup from his lips.

</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Christ's reign in his Church is that of a shepherd-king. He has upremacy, but it is the superiority of a wise and tender shepherd over is needy and loving flock; he commands and receives obedience, but it s the willing obedience of the well-cared-for sheep, rendered joyfully o their beloved Shepherd, whose voice they know so well. He rules by he force of love and the energy of goodness.</p>
<p>His reign is practical in its character. It is said, "He shall stand nd feed." The great Head of the Church is actively engaged in roviding for his people. He does not sit down upon the throne in empty tate, or hold a sceptre without wielding it in government. No, he tands and feeds. The expression "feed," in the original, is like an nalogous one in the Greek, which means to shepherdize, to do verything expected of a shepherd: to guide, to watch, to preserve, to estore, to tend, as well as to feed.</p>
<p>His reign is continual in its duration. It is said, "He shall stand and eed;" not "He shall feed now and then, and leave his position;" not, "He shall one day grant a revival, and then next day leave his Church o barrenness." His eyes never slumber, and his hands never rest; his eart never ceases to beat with love, and his shoulders are never weary f carrying his people's burdens.</p>
<p>His reign is effectually powerful in its action; "He shall feed in the trength of Jehovah." Wherever Christ is, there is God; and whatever hrist does is the act of the Most High. Oh! it is a joyful truth to onsider that he who stands today representing the interests of his eople is very God of very God, to whom every knee shall bow. Happy are e who belong to such a shepherd, whose humanity communes with us, and hose divinity protects us. Let us worship and bow down before him as he people of his pasture.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Among all the saints whose lives are recorded in Holy Writ, David ossesses an experience of the most striking, varied, and instructive haracter. In his history we meet with trials and temptations not to be iscovered, as a whole, in other saints of ancient times, and hence he s all the more suggestive a type of our Lord. David knew the trials of ll ranks and conditions of men. Kings have their troubles, and David ore a crown: the peasant has his cares, and David handled a shepherd's rook: the wanderer has many hardships, and David abode in the caves of ngedi: the captain has his difficulties, and David found the sons of eruiah too hard for him. The psalmist was also tried in his friends, is counsellor Ahithophel forsook him, "He that eateth bread with me, ath lifted up his heel against me." His worst foes were they of his wn household: his children were his greatest affliction. The emptations of poverty and wealth, of honour and reproach, of health nd weakness, all tried their power upon him. He had temptations from ithout to disturb his peace, and from within to mar his joy. David no ooner escaped from one trial than he fell into another; no sooner merged from one season of despondency and alarm, than he was again rought into the lowest depths, and all God's waves and billows rolled ver him. It is probably from this cause that David's psalms are so niversally the delight of experienced Christians. Whatever our frame f mind, whether ecstasy or depression, David has exactly described our motions. He was an able master of the human heart, because he had been utored in the best of all schools--the school of heart-felt, personal xperience. As we are instructed in the same school, as we grow matured n grace and in years, we increasingly appreciate David's psalms, and ind them to be "green pastures." My soul, let David's experience cheer nd counsel thee this day.</p>

<p>Cities well fortified have broad walls, and so had Jerusalem in her lory. The New Jerusalem must, in like manner, be surrounded and reserved by a broad wall of nonconformity to the world, and separation rom its customs and spirit. The tendency of these days break down the oly barrier, and make the distinction between the church and the world erely nominal. Professors are no longer strict and Puritanical, uestionable literature is read on all hands, frivolous pastimes are urrently indulged, and a general laxity threatens to deprive the ord's peculiar people of those sacred singularities which separate hem from sinners. It will be an ill day for the church and the world hen the proposed amalgamation shall be complete, and the sons of God nd the daughters of men shall be as one: then shall another deluge of rath be ushered in. Beloved reader, be it your aim in heart, in word, n dress, in action to maintain the broad wall, remembering that the riendship of this world is enmity against God.</p>
<p>The broad wall afforded a pleasant place of resort for the inhabitants f Jerusalem, from which they could command prospects of the urrounding country. This reminds us of the Lord's exceeding broad ommandments, in which we walk at liberty in communion with Jesus, verlooking the scenes of earth, and looking out towards the glories of eaven. Separated from the world, and denying ourselves all ungodliness nd fleshly lusts, we are nevertheless not in prison, nor restricted ithin narrow bounds; nay, we walk at liberty, because we keep his recepts. Come, reader, this evening walk with God in his statutes. As riend met friend upon the city wall, so meet thou thy God in the way f holy prayer and meditation.

<p>We may gain much solace by considering what God has not said. What he as said is inexpressibly full of comfort and delight; what he has not aid is scarcely less rich in consolation. It was one of these "said ots" which preserved the kingdom of Israel in the days of Jeroboam the on of Joash, for "the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of srael from under heaven." 2 Kings 14:27. In our text we have an ssurance that God will answer prayer, because he hath "not said unto he seed of Israel, Seek ye me in vain." You who write bitter things gainst yourselves should remember that, let your doubts and fears say hat they will, if God has not cut you off from mercy, there is no room or despair: even the voice of conscience is of little weight if it be ot seconded by the voice of God. What God has said, tremble at! But uffer not your vain imaginings to overwhelm you with despondency and inful despair. Many timid persons have been vexed by the suspicion hat there may be something in God's decree which shuts them out from ope, but here is a complete refutation to that troublesome fear, for o true seeker can be decreed to wrath. "I have not spoken in secret, n a dark place of the earth; I have not said," even in the secret of y unsearchable decree, "Seek ye me in vain." God has clearly revealed hat he will hear the prayer of those who call upon him, and that eclaration cannot be contravened. He has so firmly, so truthfully, so ighteously spoken, that there can be no room for doubt. He does not eveal his mind in unintelligible words, but he speaks plainly and ositively, "Ask, and ye shall receive." Believe, O trembler, this sure ruth--that prayer must and shall be heard, and that never, even in the ecrets of eternity, has the Lord said unto any living soul, "Seek ye e in vain."</p>

<p>Such is the language of the believer panting after present fellowship ith Jesus, he is sick for his Lord.

What the sun is to the day, hat the moon is to the night, what the dew is to the flower, such is esus Christ to us. What bread is to the hungry, clothing to the naked, he shadow of a great rock to the traveller in a weary land, such is esus Christ to us; and, therefore, if we are not consciously one with im, little marvel if our spirit cries in the words of the Song, "I harge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, tell im that I am sick of love." This earnest longing after Jesus has a lessing attending it: "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst fter righteousness"; and therefore, supremely blessed are they who hirst after the Righteous One. Blessed is that hunger, since it comes rom God: if I may not have the full-blown blessedness of being filled,  would seek the same blessedness in its sweet bud-pining in emptiness nd eagerness till I am filled with Christ. If I may not feed on Jesus, t shall be next door to heaven to hunger and thirst after him. There s a hallowedness about that hunger, since it sparkles among the eatitudes of our Lord. But the blessing involves a promise. Such ungry ones "shall be filled" with what they are desiring. If Christ hus causes us to long after himself, he will certainly satisfy those ongings; and when he does come to us, as come he will, oh, how sweet t will be!</p>

<p>My Master has riches beyond the count of arithmetic, the measurement of eason, the dream of imagination, or the eloquence of words. They are nsearchable! You may look, and study, and weigh, but Jesus is a reater Saviour than you think him to be when your thoughts are at the reatest. My Lord is more ready to pardon than you to sin, more able to orgive than you to transgress. My Master is more willing to supply our wants than you are to confess them. Never tolerate low thoughts of y Lord Jesus. When you put the crown on his head, you will only crown im with silver when he deserves gold. My Master has riches of appiness to bestow upon you now. He can make you to lie down in green astures, and lead you beside still waters. There is no music like the usic of his pipe, when he is the Shepherd and you are the sheep, and ou lie down at his feet. There is no love like his, neither earth nor eaven can match it. To know Christ and to be found in him--oh! this is ife, this is joy, this is marrow and fatness, wine on the lees well efined. My Master does not treat his servants churlishly; he gives to hem as a king giveth to a king; he gives them two heavens--a heaven elow in serving him here, and a heaven above in delighting in him orever. His unsearchable riches will be best known in eternity. He ill give you on the way to heaven all you need; your place of defence hall be the munitions of rocks, your bread shall be given you, and our waters shall be sure; but it is there, there, where you shall hear he song of them that triumph, the shout of them that feast, and shall ave a face-to-face view of the glorious and beloved One. The nsearchable riches of Christ! This is the tune for the minstrels of arth, and the song for the harpers of heaven. Lord, teach us more and ore of Jesus, and we will tell out the good news to others.</p>

<p>The glorified weep no more, for all outward causes of grief are gone. here are no broken friendships, nor blighted prospects in heaven. overty, famine, peril, persecution, and slander, are unknown there. No ain distresses, no thought of death or bereavement saddens. They weep o more, for they are perfectly sanctified. No "evil heart of unbelief" prompts them to depart from the living God; they are without fault efore his throne, and are fully conformed to his image. Well may they ease to mourn who have ceased to sin. They weep no more, because all ear of change is past. They know that they are eternally secure. Sin s shut out, and they are shut in. They dwell within a city which shall ever be stormed; they bask in a sun which shall never set; they drink f a river which shall never dry; they pluck fruit from a tree which hall never wither. Countless cycles may revolve, but eternity shall ot be exhausted, and while eternity endures, their immortality and lessedness shall co-exist with it. They are forever with the Lord. hey weep no more, because every desire is fulfilled. They cannot wish or anything which they have not in possession. Eye and ear, heart and and, judgment, imagination, hope, desire, will, all the faculties, are ompletely satisfied; and imperfect as our present ideas are of the hings which God hath prepared for them that love him, yet we know nough, by the revelation of the Spirit, that the saints above are upremely blessed. The joy of Christ, which is an infinite fulness of elight, is in them. They bathe themselves in the bottomless, shoreless ea of infinite beatitude. That same joyful rest remains for us. It may ot be far distant. Ere long the weeping willow shall be exchanged for he palm-branch of victory, and sorrow's dewdrops will be transformed nto the pearls of everlasting bliss. "Wherefore comfort one another ith these words."</p>

<p>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Ephesians</span> <span class="chapter">3</span>:<span class="verse">17</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Beyond measure it is desirable that we, as believers, should have the erson of Jesus constantly before us, to inflame our love towards him, nd to increase our knowledge of him. I would to God that my readers ere all entered as diligent scholars in Jesus' college, students of orpus Christi, or the body of Christ, resolved to attain unto a good egree in the learning of the cross. But to have Jesus ever near, the eart must be full of him, welling up with his love, even to verrunning; hence the apostle prays "that Christ may dwell in your earts." See how near he would have Jesus to be! You cannot get a ubject closer to you than to have it in the heart itself. "That he may well;" not that he may call upon you sometimes, as a casual visitor nters into a house and tarries for a night, but that he may dwell; hat Jesus may become the Lord and Tenant of your inmost being, never ore to go out.</p>
<p>Observe the words--that he may dwell in your heart, that best room of he house of manhood; not in your thoughts alone, but in your ffections; not merely in the mind's meditations, but in the heart's motions. We should pant after love to Christ of a most abiding haracter, not a love that flames up and then dies out into the arkness of a few embers, but a constant flame, fed by sacred fuel, ike the fire upon the altar which never went out. This cannot be ccomplished except by faith. Faith must be strong, or love will not be ervent; the root of the flower must be healthy, or we cannot expect he bloom to be sweet. Faith is the lily's root, and love is the lily's loom. Now, reader, Jesus cannot be in your heart's love except you ave a firm hold of him by your heart's faith; and, therefore, pray hat you may always trust Christ in order that you may always love him. f love be cold, be sure that faith is drooping.</p>

<p>If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or he standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled he fire shall surely make restitution.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Exodus</span> <span class="chapter">22</span>:<span class="verse">6</span></cite>

<div class="response">
<p>But what restitution can he make who casts abroad the fire-brands of rror, or the coals of lasciviousness, and sets men's souls on a blaze ith the fire of hell? The guilt is beyond estimate, and the result is rretrievable. If such an offender be forgiven, what grief it will ause him in the retrospect, since he cannot undo the mischief which he as done! An ill example may kindle a flame which years of amended haracter cannot quench. To burn the food of man is bad enough, but how uch worse to destroy the soul! It may be useful to us to reflect how ar we may have been guilty in the past, and to enquire whether, even n the present, there may not be evil in us which has a tendency to ring damage to the souls of our relatives, friends, or neighbours.</p>
<p>The fire of strife is a terrible evil when it breaks out in a Christian hurch. Where converts were multiplied, and God was glorified, jealousy nd envy do the devil's work most effectually. Where the golden grain as being housed, to reward the toil of the great Boaz, the fire of nmity comes in and leaves little else but smoke and a heap of lackness. Woe unto those by whom offences come. May they never come hrough us, for although we cannot make restitution, we shall certainly e the chief sufferers if we are the chief offenders. Those who feed he fire deserve just censure, but he who first kindles it is most to lame. Discord usually takes first hold upon the thorns; it is nurtured mong the hypocrites and base professors in the church, and away it oes among the righteous, blown by the winds of hell, and no one knows here it may end. O thou Lord and giver of peace, make us peacemakers, nd never let us aid and abet the men of strife, or even nintentionally cause the least division among thy people.</p>

<p>His fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Song of Solomon</span> <span class="chapter">2</span>:<span class="verse">3</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Faith, in the Scripture, is spoken of under the emblem of all the enses. It is sight: "Look unto me and be ye saved." It is hearing: "Hear, and your soul shall live." Faith is smelling: "All thy garments mell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia"; "thy name is as ointment poured orth." Faith is spiritual touch. By this faith the woman came behind nd touched the hem of Christ's garment, and by this we handle the hings of the good word of life. Faith is equally the spirit's taste.</p>
<p>"How sweet are thy words to my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my ips." "Except a man eat my flesh," saith Christ, "and drink my blood, here is no life in him."</p>
<p>This "taste" is faith in one of its highest operations. One of the irst performances of faith is hearing. We hear the voice of God, not ith the outward ear alone, but with the inward ear; we hear it as od's Word, and we believe it to be so; that is the "hearing" of faith. hen our mind looketh upon the truth as it is presented to us; that is o say, we understand it, we perceive its meaning; that is the "seeing" of faith. Next we discover its preciousness; we begin to admire it, and ind how fragrant it is; that is faith in its "smell." Then we ppropriate the mercies which are prepared for us in Christ; that is aith in its "touch." Hence follow the enjoyments, peace, delight, ommunion; which are faith in its "taste." Any one of these acts of aith is saving. To hear Christ's voice as the sure voice of God in the oul will save us; but that which gives true enjoyment is the aspect of aith wherein Christ, by holy taste, is received into us, and made, by nward and spiritual apprehension of his sweetness and preciousness, to e the food of our souls. It is then we sit "under his shadow with reat delight," and find his fruit sweet to our taste.</p>

<p>These words may answer your scruples, devout reader, concerning the rdinances. Perhaps you say, "I should be afraid to be baptized; it is uch a solemn thing to avow myself to be dead with Christ, and buried ith him. I should not feel at liberty to come to the Master's table; I hould be afraid of eating and drinking damnation unto myself, not iscerning the Lord's body." Ah! poor trembler, Jesus has given you iberty, be not afraid. If a stranger came to your house, he would tand at the door, or wait in the hall; he would not dream of intruding nbidden into your parlour--he is not at home: but your child makes imself very free about the house; and so is it with the child of God.  stranger may not intrude where a child may venture. When the Holy host has given you to feel the spirit of adoption, you may come to hristian ordinances without fear. The same rule holds good of the hristian's inward privileges. You think, poor seeker, that you are not llowed to rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory; if you are ermitted to get inside Christ's door, or sit at the bottom of his able, you will be well content. Ah! but you shall not have less rivileges than the very greatest. God makes no difference in his love o his children. A child is a child to him; he will not make him a ired servant; but he shall feast upon the fatted calf, and shall have he music and the dancing as much as if he had never gone astray. When esus comes into the heart, he issues a general licence to be glad in he Lord. No chains are worn in the court of King Jesus. Our admission nto full privileges may be gradual, but it is sure. Perhaps our reader s saying, "I wish I could enjoy the promises, and walk at liberty in y Lord's commands." "If thou believest with all thine heart, thou ayest." Loose the chains of thy neck, O captive daughter, for Jesus akes thee free.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>The Lord's people delight in the covenant itself. It is an unfailing ource of consolation to them so often as the Holy Spirit leads them nto its banqueting house and waves its banner of love. They delight to ontemplate the antiquity of that covenant, remembering that before the ay-star knew its place, or planets ran their round, the interests of he saints were made secure in Christ Jesus. It is peculiarly pleasing o them to remember the sureness of the covenant, while meditating upon "the sure mercies of David." They delight to celebrate it as "signed, nd sealed, and ratified, in all things ordered well." It often makes heir hearts dilate with joy to think of its immutability, as a ovenant which neither time nor eternity, life nor death, shall ever be ble to violate--a covenant as old as eternity and as everlasting as he Rock of ages. They rejoice also to feast upon the fulness of this ovenant, for they see in it all things provided for them. God is their ortion, Christ their companion, the Spirit their Comforter, earth heir lodge, and heaven their home. They see in it an inheritance eserved and entailed to every soul possessing an interest in its ncient and eternal deed of gift. Their eyes sparkled when they saw it s a treasure-trove in the Bible; but oh! how their souls were laddened when they saw in the last will and testament of their divine insman, that it was bequeathed to them! More especially it is the leasure of God's people to contemplate the graciousness of this ovenant. They see that the law was made void because it was a covenant f works and depended upon merit, but this they perceive to be enduring ecause grace is the basis, grace the condition, grace the strain, race the bulwark, grace the foundation, grace the topstone. The ovenant is a treasury of wealth, a granary of food, a fountain of ife, a store-house of salvation, a charter of peace, and a haven of oy.</p>

<p>How great the difference between Moses and Jesus! When the prophet of oreb had been forty days upon the mountain, he underwent a kind of ransfiguration, so that his countenance shone with exceeding rightness, and he put a veil over his face, for the people could not ndure to look upon his glory. Not so our Saviour. He had been ransfigured with a greater glory than that of Moses, and yet, it is ot written that the people were blinded by the blaze of his ountenance, but rather they were amazed, and running to him they aluted him. The glory of the law repels, but the greater glory of esus attracts. Though Jesus is holy and just, yet blended with his urity there is so much of truth and grace, that sinners run to him mazed at his goodness, fascinated by his love; they salute him, become is disciples, and take him to be their Lord and Master. Reader, it may e that just now you are blinded by the dazzling brightness of the law f God. You feel its claims on your conscience, but you cannot keep it n your life. Not that you find fault with the law, on the contrary, it ommands your profoundest esteem, still you are in nowise drawn by it o God; you are rather hardened in heart, and are verging towards esperation. Ah, poor heart! turn thine eye from Moses, with all his epelling splendour, and look to Jesus, resplendent with milder lories. Behold his flowing wounds and thorn-crowned head! He is the on of God, and therein he is greater than Moses, but he is the Lord of ove, and therein more tender than the lawgiver. He bore the wrath of od, and in his death revealed more of God's justice than Sinai on a laze, but that justice is now vindicated, and henceforth it is the uardian of believers in Jesus. Look, sinner, to the bleeding Saviour, nd as thou feelest the attraction of his love, fly to his arms, and hou shalt be saved.</p>

<p>Strive with all diligence to keep out that monster unbelief. It so ishonours Christ, that he will withdraw his visible presence if we nsult him by indulging it.

Its injurious nature is so venomous that he that xerciseth it and he upon whom it is exercised are both hurt thereby. n thy case, O believer! it is most wicked, for the mercies of thy Lord n the past, increase thy guilt in doubting him now. When thou dost istrust the Lord Jesus, he may well cry out, "Behold I am pressed nder you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves." This is rowning his head with thorns of the sharpest kind. It is very cruel or a well-beloved wife to mistrust a kind and faithful husband. The in is needless, foolish, and unwarranted. Jesus has never given the lightest ground for suspicion, and it is hard to be doubted by those o whom our conduct is uniformly affectionate and true. Jesus is the on of the Highest, and has unbounded wealth; it is shameful to doubt mnipotence and distrust all-sufficiency. The cattle on a thousand ills will suffice for our most hungry feeding, and the granaries of eaven are not likely to be emptied by our eating. If Christ were only  cistern, we might soon exhaust his fulness, but who can drain a ountain? Myriads of spirits have drawn their supplies from him, and ot one of them has murmured at the scantiness of his resources. Away, hen, with this lying traitor unbelief, for his only errand is to cut he bonds of communion and make us mourn an absent Saviour.

<p>These words have been frequently used by holy men in their hour of eparture. We may profitably consider them this evening. The object of he faithful man's solicitude in life and death is not his body or his state, but his spirit; this is his choice treasure--if this be safe, ll is well. What is this mortal state compared with the soul? The eliever commits his soul to the hand of his God; it came from him, it s his own, he has aforetime sustained it, he is able to keep it, and t is most fit that he should receive it. All things are safe in ehovah's hands; what we entrust to the Lord will be secure, both now nd in that day of days towards which we are hastening. It is peaceful iving, and glorious dying, to repose in the care of heaven. At all imes we should commit our all to Jesus' faithful hand; then, though ife may hang on a thread, and adversities may multiply as the sands of he sea, our soul shall dwell at ease, and delight itself in quiet esting places.</p>

<p>Though we have brought forth some fruit unto Christ, and have a joyful ope that we are "plants of his own right hand planting," yet there are imes when we feel very barren. Prayer is lifeless, love is cold, faith s weak, each grace in the garden of our heart languishes and droops. e are like flowers in the hot sun, requiring the refreshing shower. In uch a condition what are we to do? The text is addressed to us in just uch a state. "Sing, O barren, break forth and cry aloud." But what can  sing about? I cannot talk about the present, and even the past looks ull of barrenness. Ah! I can sing of Jesus Christ. I can talk of isits which the Redeemer has aforetimes paid to me; or if not of hese, I can magnify the great love wherewith he loved his people when e came from the heights of heaven for their redemption. I will go to he cross again. Come, my soul, heavy laden thou wast once, and thou idst lose thy burden there. Go to Calvary again. Perhaps that very ross which gave thee life may give thee fruitfulness. What is my arrenness? It is the platform for his fruit-creating power. What is my esolation? It is the black setting for the sapphire of his everlasting ove. I will go in poverty, I will go in helplessness, I will go in all y shame and backsliding, I will tell him that I am still his child, nd in confidence in his faithful heart, even I, the barren one, will ing and cry aloud.</p>
<p>Sing, believer, for it will cheer thine own heart, and the hearts of ther desolate ones. Sing on, for now that thou art really ashamed of eing barren, thou wilt be fruitful soon; now that God makes thee loath o be without fruit he will soon cover thee with clusters. The xperience of our barrenness is painful, but the Lord's visitations are elightful. A sense of our own poverty drives us to Christ, and that is here we need to be, for in him is our fruit found.</p>

We have need that the Lord should have mercy upon our ood works, our prayers, our preachings, our alms-givings, and our oliest things.

If mercy be needed o be exercised towards our duties, what shall be said of our sins? How weet the remembrance that inexhaustible mercy is waiting to be racious to us, to restore our backslidings, and make our broken bones ejoice!</p>

<p>Nazarites had taken, among other vows, one which debarred them from the se of wine. In order that they might not violate the obligation, they ere forbidden to drink the vinegar of wine or strong liquors, and to ake the rule still more clear, they were not to touch the unfermented uice of grapes, nor even to eat the fruit either fresh or dried. In rder, altogether, to secure the integrity of the vow, they were not ven allowed anything that had to do with the vine; they were, in fact, o avoid the appearance of evil. Surely this is a lesson to the Lord's eparated ones, teaching them to come away from sin in every form, to void not merely its grosser shapes, but even its spirit and imilitude. Strict walking is much despised in these days, but rest ssured, dear reader, it is both the safest and the happiest. He who ields a point or two to the world is in fearful peril; he who eats the rapes of Sodom will soon drink the wine of Gomorrah. A little crevice n the sea-bank in Holland lets in the sea, and the gap speedily swells ill a province is drowned. Worldly conformity, in any degree, is a nare to the soul, and makes it more and more liable to presumptuous ins. Moreover, as the Nazarite who drank grape juice could not be uite sure whether it might not have endured a degree of fermentation, nd consequently could not be clear in heart that his vow was intact, o the yielding, temporizing Christian cannot wear a conscience void of ffence, but must feel that the inward monitor is in doubt of him. hings doubtful we need not doubt about; they are wrong to us. Things empting we must not dally with, but flee from them with speed. Better e sneered at as a Puritan than be despised as a hypocrite. Careful alking may involve much self-denial, but it has pleasures of its own hich are more than a sufficient recompense.</p>

<p>It may seem an easy thing to wait, but it is one of the postures which  Christian soldier learns not without years of teaching. Marching and uick-marching are much easier to God's warriors than standing still. here are hours of perplexity when the most willing spirit, anxiously esirous to serve the Lord, knows not what part to take. Then what hall it do? Vex itself by despair? Fly back in cowardice, turn to the ight hand in fear, or rush forward in presumption? No, but simply ait. Wait in prayer, however. Call upon God, and spread the case efore him; tell him your difficulty, and plead his promise of aid. In ilemmas between one duty and another, it is sweet to be humble as a hild, and wait with simplicity of soul upon the Lord. It is sure to be ell with us when we feel and know our own folly, and are heartily illing to be guided by the will of God. But wait in faith. Express our unstaggering confidence in him; for unfaithful, untrusting aiting, is but an insult to the Lord. Believe that if he keep you arrying even till midnight, yet he will come at the right time; the ision shall come and shall not tarry. Wait in quiet patience, not ebelling because you are under the affliction, but blessing your God or it. Never murmur against the second cause, as the children of srael did against Moses; never wish you could go back to the world gain, but accept the case as it is, and put it as it stands, simply nd with your whole heart, without any self-will, into the hand of your ovenant God, saying, "Now, Lord, not my will, but thine be done. I now not what to do; I am brought to extremities, but I will wait until hou shalt cleave the floods, or drive back my foes. I will wait, if hou keep me many a day, for my heart is fixed upon thee alone, O God, nd my spirit waiteth for thee in the full conviction that thou wilt et be my joy and my salvation, my refuge and my strong tower."</p>

"I will heal thee of thy wounds," is a promise which could not ome from the lip of man, but only from the mouth of the eternal God. n this account the psalmist cried unto the Lord, "O Lord, heal me, for y bones are sore vexed," and again, "Heal my soul, for I have sinned gainst thee." For this, also, the godly praise the name of the Lord, aying, "He healeth all our diseases." He who made man can restore man; e who was at first the creator of our nature can new create it.

<p>As he is in the light! Can we ever attain to this? Shall we ever be ble to walk as clearly in the light as he is whom we call "Our ather," of whom it is written, "God is light, and in him is no arkness at all?" Certainly, this is the model which is set before us, or the Saviour himself said, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father who s in heaven is perfect;" and although we may feel that we can never ival the perfection of God, yet we are to seek after it, and never to e satisfied until we attain to it. The youthful artist, as he grasps is early pencil, can hardly hope to equal Raphael or Michael Angelo, ut still, if he did not have a noble beau ideal before his mind, he ould only attain to something very mean and ordinary. But what is eant by the expression that the Christian is to walk in light as God s in the light? We conceive it to import likeness, but not degree. We re as truly in the light, we are as heartily in the light, we are as incerely in the light, as honestly in the light, though we cannot be here in the same measure. I cannot dwell in the sun, it is too bright  place for my residence, but I can walk in the light of the sun; and o, though I cannot attain to that perfection of purity and truth which elongs to the Lord of hosts by nature as the infinitely good, yet I an set the Lord always before me, and strive, by the help of the ndwelling Spirit, after conformity to his image. That famous old ommentator, John Trapp, says, "We may be in the light as God is in the ight for quality, but not for equality." We are to have the same ight, and are as truly to have it and walk in it as God does, though, s for equality with God in his holiness and purity, that must be left ntil we cross the Jordan and enter into the perfection of the Most igh. Mark that the blessings of sacred fellowship and perfect leansing are bound up with walking in the light.</p>

Many nowadays must see signs and wonders, or they ill not believe. Some have said in their heart, "I must feel deep orror of soul, or I never will believe in Jesus." But what if you ever should feel it, as probably you never may? Will you go to hell ut of spite against God, because he will not treat you like another? ne has said to himself, "If I had a dream, or if I could feel a sudden hock of I know not what, then I would believe." Thus you undeserving ortals dream that my Lord is to be dictated to by you!

Why, dear reader, if such be your case, do you crave for signs nd wonders? Is not the gospel its own sign and wonder? Is not this a iracle of miracles, that "God so loved the world that he gave his only egotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him might not perish"? Surely hat precious word, "Whosoever will, let him come and take the water of ife freely" and that solemn promise, "Him that cometh unto me, I will n no wise cast out," are better than signs and wonders!

<p>It is well to be able, without any "if" or "but," to say of the Lord esus--"Thou whom my soul loveth." Many can only say of Jesus that they ope they love him; they trust they love him; but only a poor and hallow experience will be content to stay here. No one ought to give ny rest to his spirit till he feels quite sure about a matter of such ital importance. We ought not to be satisfied with a superficial hope hat Jesus loves us, and with a bare trust that we love him. The old aints did not generally speak with "buts," and "ifs," and "hopes," and "trusts," but they spoke positively and plainly. "I know whom I have elieved," saith Paul. "I know that my Redeemer liveth," saith Job. Get ositive knowledge of your love of Jesus, and be not satisfied till you an speak of your interest in him as a reality, which you have made ure by having received the witness of the Holy Spirit, and his seal pon your soul by faith.</p>
<p>True love to Christ is in every case the Holy Spirit's work, and must e wrought in the heart by him. He is the efficient cause of it; but he logical reason why we love Jesus lies in himself. Why do we love esus? Because he first loved us. Why do we love Jesus? Because he "gave himself for us." We have life through his death; we have peace hrough his blood. Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became oor. Why do we love Jesus? Because of the excellency of his person. We re filled with a sense of his beauty! an admiration of his charms! a onsciousness of his infinite perfection! His greatness, goodness, and oveliness, in one resplendent ray, combine to enchant the soul till it s so ravished that it exclaims, "Yea, he is altogether lovely." Blessed love this--a love which binds the heart with chains more soft han silk, and yet more firm than adamant!</p>

Even our mercies, like oses, have their thorns. Men may be drowned in seas of prosperity as ell as in rivers of affliction. Our mountains are not too high, and ur valleys are not too low for temptations: trials lurk on all roads. verywhere, above and beneath, we are beset and surrounded with angers. Yet no shower falls unpermitted from the threatening cloud; very drop has its order ere it hastens to the earth. The trials which ome from God are sent to prove and strengthen our graces, and so at nce to illustrate the power of divine grace, to test the genuineness f our virtues, and to add to their energy. Our Lord in his infinite isdom and superabundant love, sets so high a value upon his people's aith that he will not screen them from those trials by which faith is trengthened. You would never have possessed the precious faith which ow supports you if the trial of your faith had not been like unto ire.

The balloon never rises until the cords are cut; ffliction doth this sharp service for believing souls. While the wheat leeps comfortably in the husk it is useless to man, it must be hreshed out of its resting place before its value can be known.

Jesus heals all who come, and casts out none. In reading he narrative in which our morning's text occurs, it is worthy of evout notice that Jesus touched the leper. This unclean person had roken through the regulations of the ceremonial law and pressed into he house, but Jesus so far from chiding him broke through the law imself in order to meet him. He made an interchange with the leper, or while he cleansed him, he contracted by that touch a Levitical efilement. Even so Jesus Christ was made sin for us, although in imself he knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God n him. O that poor sinners would go to Jesus, believing in the power f his blessed substitutionary work, and they would soon learn the ower of his gracious touch.

Like Daniel, ompel them to say of you, "We shall not find any occasion against this aniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God." Seek to be useful as well as consistent. Perhaps you think, "If I were n a more favourable position I might serve the Lord's cause, but I annot do any good where I am"; but the worse the people are among whom ou live, the more need have they of your exertions; if they be rooked, the more necessity that you should set them straight; and if hey be perverse, the more need have you to turn their proud hearts to he truth. Where should the physician be but where there are many sick? here is honour to be won by the soldier but in the hottest fire of the attle? And when weary of the strife and sin that meets you on every and, consider that all the saints have endured the same trial. They ere not carried on beds of down to heaven, and you must not expect to ravel more easily than they. They had to hazard their lives unto the eath in the high places of the field, and you will not be crowned till ou also have endured hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. herefore, "stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."</p>

<p>Some things in nature must remain a mystery to the most intelligent and nterprising investigators. Human knowledge has bounds beyond which it annot pass. Universal knowledge is for God alone. If this be so in the hings which are seen and temporal, I may rest assured that it is even ore so in matters spiritual and eternal. Why, then, have I been orturing my brain with speculations as to destiny and will, fixed ate, and human responsibility? These deep and dark truths I am no more ble to comprehend than to find out the depth which coucheth beneath, rom which old ocean draws her watery stores. Why am I so curious to now the reason of my Lord's providences, the motive of his actions, he design of his visitations? Shall I ever be able to clasp the sun in y fist, and hold the universe in my palm? yet these are as a drop of a ucket compared with the Lord my God. Let me not strive to understand he infinite, but spend my strength in love. What I cannot gain by ntellect I can possess by affection, and let that suffice me. I cannot enetrate the heart of the sea, but I can enjoy the healthful breezes hich sweep over its bosom, and I can sail over its blue waves with ropitious winds. If I could enter the springs of the sea, the feat ould serve no useful purpose either to myself or to others, it would ot save the sinking bark, or give back the drowned mariner to his eeping wife and children; neither would my solving deep mysteries vail me a single whit, for the least love to God, and the simplest act f obedience to him, are better than the profoundest knowledge. My ord, I leave the infinite to thee, and pray thee to put far from me uch a love for the tree of knowledge as might keep me from the tree of ife.</p>

We are to point sinners to he Saviour, and the weary to a divine resting-place. Men sometimes ead their Bibles, and fail to understand them; we should be ready, ike Philip, to instruct the inquirer in the meaning of God's Word, the ay of salvation, and the life of godliness. Lights are also used for arning. On our rocks and shoals a light-house is sure to be erected. hristian men should know that there are many false lights shown verywhere in the world, and therefore the right light is needed.

<p>He who looks at his own character and position from a legal point of iew, will not only despair when he comes to the end of his reckoning, ut if he be a wise man he will despair at the beginning; for if we are o be judged on the footing of the law, there shall no flesh living be ustified. How blessed to know that we dwell in the domains of grace nd not of law! When thinking of my state before God the question is ot, "Am I perfect in myself before the law?" but, "Am I perfect in hrist Jesus?" That is a very different matter. We need not enquire, "Am I without sin naturally?" but, "Have I been washed in the fountain pened for sin and for uncleanness?" It is not "Am I in myself well leasing to God?" but it is "Am I accepted in the Beloved?" The hristian views his evidences from the top of Sinai, and grows alarmed oncerning his salvation; it were better far if he read his title by he light of Calvary. "Why," saith he, "my faith has unbelief in it, it s not able to save me." Suppose he had considered the object of his aith instead of his faith, then he would have said, "There is no ailure in him, and therefore I am safe." He sighs over his hope: "Ah! y hope is marred and dimmed by an anxious carefulness about present hings; how can I be accepted?" Had he regarded the ground of his hope, e would have seen that the promise of God standeth sure, and that hatever our doubts may be, the oath and promise never fail. Ah! eliever, it is safer always for you to be led of the Spirit into ospel liberty than to wear legal fetters. Judge yourself at what hrist is rather than at what you are. Satan will try to mar your peace y reminding you of your sinfulness and imperfections: you can only eet his accusations by faithfully adhering to the gospel and refusing o wear the yoke of bondage.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Our fruit is found from our God as to union. The fruit of the branch is irectly traceable to the root. Sever the connection, the branch dies, nd no fruit is produced. By virtue of our union with Christ we bring orth fruit. Every bunch of grapes has been first in the root, it has assed through the stem, and flowed through the sap vessels, and ashioned itself externally into fruit, but it was first in the stem; o also every good work was first in Christ, and then is brought forth n us. O Christian, prize this precious union to Christ; for it must be he source of all the fruitfulness which thou canst hope to know. If hou wert not joined to Jesus Christ, thou wouldst be a barren bough ndeed.</p>
<p>Our fruit comes from God as to spiritual providence. When the dew-drops all from heaven, when the cloud looks down from on high, and is about o distil its liquid treasure, when the bright sun swells the berries f the cluster, each heavenly boon may whisper to the tree and say, "From me is thy fruit found." The fruit owes much to the root--that is ssential to fruitfulness--but it owes very much also to external nfluences. How much we owe to God's grace-providence! in which he rovides us constantly with quickening, teaching, consolation, trength, or whatever else we want. To this we owe our all of sefulness or virtue.</p>
<p>Our fruit comes from God as to wise husbandry. The gardener's harp-edged knife promotes the fruitfulness of the tree, by thinning he clusters, and by cutting off superfluous shoots. So is it, hristian, with that pruning which the Lord gives to thee. "My Father s the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh way; and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it, that it may ring forth more fruit." Since our God is the author of our spiritual races, let us give to him all the glory of our salvation.</p>

<p>In the resurrection of Christ, as in our salvation, there was put forth othing short of a divine power. What shall we say of those who think hat conversion is wrought by the free will of man, and is due to his wn betterness of disposition? When we shall see the dead rise from the rave by their own power, then may we expect to see ungodly sinners of heir own free will turning to Christ. It is not the word preached, nor he word read in itself; all quickening power proceeds from the Holy host. This power was irresistible. All the soldiers and the high riests could not keep the body of Christ in the tomb; Death himself ould not hold Jesus in his bonds: even thus irresistible is the power ut forth in the believer when he is raised to newness of life. No sin, o corruption, no devils in hell nor sinners upon earth, can stay the and of God's grace when it intends to convert a man. If God mnipotently says, "Thou shalt," man shall not say, "I will not." Observe that the power which raised Christ from the dead was glorious. t reflected honour upon God and wrought dismay in the hosts of evil. o there is great glory to God in the conversion of every sinner. It as everlasting power. "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no ore; death hath no more dominion over him." So we, being raised from he dead, go not back to our dead works nor to our old corruptions, but e live unto God. "Because he lives we live also." "For we are dead, nd our life is hid with Christ in God." "Like as Christ was raised up rom the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk n newness of life." Lastly, in the text mark the union of the new life o Jesus. The same power which raised the Head works life in the embers. What a blessing to be quickened together with Christ!</p>

<p>There are different translations of these words. One version renders t, "I will shew thee great and fortified things." Another, "Great and eserved things." Now, there are reserved and special things in hristian experience: all the developments of spiritual life are not like easy of attainment. There are the common frames and feelings of epentance, and faith, and joy, and hope, which are enjoyed by the ntire family; but there is an upper realm of rapture, of communion, nd conscious union with Christ, which is far from being the common welling-place of believers. We have not all the high privilege of ohn, to lean upon Jesus' bosom; nor of Paul, to be caught up into the hird heaven. There are heights in experimental knowledge of the things f God which the eagle's eye of acumen and philosophic thought hath ever seen: God alone can bear us there; but the chariot in which he akes us up, and the fiery steeds with which that chariot is dragged, re prevailing prayers. Prevailing prayer is victorious over the God of ercy, "By his strength he had power with God: yea, he had power over he angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he ound him in Beth-el, and there he spake with us." Prevailing prayer akes the Christian to Carmel, and enables him to cover heaven with louds of blessing, and earth with floods of mercy. Prevailing prayer ears the Christian aloft to Pisgah, and shows him the inheritance eserved; it elevates us to Tabor and transfigures us, till in the ikeness of his Lord, as he is, so are we also in this world. If you ould reach to something higher than ordinary grovelling experience, ook to the Rock that is higher than you, and gaze with the eye of aith through the window of importunate prayer. When you open the indow on your side, it will not be bolted on the other.</p>

<p>These representatives of the saints in heaven are said to be around the hrone. In the passage in Canticles, where Solomon sings of the King itting at his table, some render it "a round table." From this, some xpositors, I think, without straining the text, have said, "There is n equality among the saints." That idea is conveyed by the equal earness of the four and twenty elders. The condition of glorified pirits in heaven is that of nearness to Christ, clear vision of his lory, constant access to his court, and familiar fellowship with his erson: nor is there any difference in this respect between one saint nd another, but all the people of God, apostles, martyrs, ministers, r private and obscure Christians, shall all be seated near the throne, here they shall forever gaze upon their exalted Lord, and be satisfied ith his love. They shall all be near to Christ, all ravished with his ove, all eating and drinking at the same table with him, all equally eloved as his favourites and friends even if not all equally rewarded s servants.</p>
<p>Let believers on earth imitate the saints in heaven in their nearness o Christ. Let us on earth be as the elders are in heaven, sitting round the throne. May Christ be the object of our thoughts, the centre f our lives. How can we endure to live at such a distance from our eloved? Lord Jesus, draw us nearer to thyself.

Jesus stands on the mountain, vermore above the world in holiness, earnestness, love and power. hose whom he calls must go up the mountain to him, they must seek to ise to his level by living in constant communion with him. They may ot be able to mount to classic honours, or attain scholastic eminence, ut they must like Moses go up into the mount of God and have familiar ntercourse with the unseen God, or they will never be fitted to roclaim the gospel of peace. Jesus went apart to hold high fellowship ith the Father, and we must enter into the same divine companionship f we would bless our fellowmen. No wonder that the apostles were lothed with power when they came down fresh from the mountain where esus was.

May not the furious creature represent ur doubts and fears after a day of distraction of mind, losses in usiness, and perhaps ungenerous tauntings from our fellow men? How our houghts howl in our ears, "Where is now thy God?" How voracious and reedy they are, swallowing up all suggestions of comfort, and emaining as hungry as before. Great Shepherd, slay these evening olves, and bid thy sheep lie down in green pastures, undisturbed by nsatiable unbelief. How like are the fiends of hell to evening wolves, or when the flock of Christ are in a cloudy and dark day, and their un seems going down, they hasten to tear and to devour. They will carcely attack the Christian in the daylight of faith, but in the loom of soul conflict they fall upon him. O thou who hast laid down hy life for the sheep, preserve them from the fangs of the wolf.</p>
<p>False teachers who craftily and industriously hunt for the precious ife, devouring men by their false-hoods, are as dangerous and etestable as evening wolves.

He loved you with such a love hat he would not stop in heaven without you; he would sooner die than ou should perish, and he cannot endure that anything should stand etween your heart's love and himself. He is very jealous of your rust. He will not permit you to trust in an arm of flesh. He cannot ear that you should hew out broken cisterns, when the overflowing ountain is always free to you. When we lean upon him, he is glad, but hen we transfer our dependence to another, when we rely upon our own isdom, or the wisdom of a friend--worst of all, when we trust in any orks of our own, he is displeased, and will chasten us that he may ring us to himself. He is also very jealous of our company. There hould be no one with whom we converse so much as with Jesus. To abide n him only, this is true love; but to commune with the world, to find ufficient solace in our carnal comforts, to prefer even the society of ur fellow Christians to secret intercourse with him, this is grievous o our jealous Lord. He would fain have us abide in him, and enjoy onstant fellowship with himself; and many of the trials which he sends s are for the purpose of weaning our hearts from the creature, and ixing them more closely upon himself. Let this jealousy which would eep us near to Christ be also a comfort to us, for if he loves us so uch as to care thus about our love we may be sure that he will suffer othing to harm us, and will protect us from all our enemies. Oh that e may have grace this day to keep our hearts in sacred chastity for ur Beloved alone, with sacred jealousy shutting our eyes to all the ascinations of the world!</p>

<p>Faith triumphs in trial. When reason is thrust into the inner prison, ith her feet made fast in the stocks, faith makes the dungeon walls ing with her merry notes as she cries, "I will sing of mercy and of udgment. Unto thee, O Lord, will I sing." Faith pulls the black mask rom the face of trouble, and discovers the angel beneath. Faith looks p at the cloud, and sees that</p>
<p>"'Tis big with mercy and shall break</p>
<p>In blessings on her head."</p>
<p>There is a subject for song even in the judgments of God towards us. or, first, the trial is not so heavy as it might have been; next, the rouble is not so severe as we deserved to have borne; and our ffliction is not so crushing as the burden which others have to carry. aith sees that in her worst sorrow there is nothing penal; there is ot a drop of God's wrath in it; it is all sent in love. Faith discerns ove gleaming like a jewel on the breast of an angry God. Faith says of er grief, "This is a badge of honour, for the child must feel the od;" and then she sings of the sweet result of her sorrows, because hey work her spiritual good. Nay, more, says Faith, "These light fflictions, which are but for a moment, work out for me a far more xceeding and eternal weight of glory." So Faith rides forth on the lack horse, conquering and to conquer, trampling down carnal reason nd fleshly sense, and chanting notes of victory amid the thickest of he fray.</p>
<p>"All I meet I find assists me</p>
<p>In my path to heavenly joy:</p>
<p>Where, though trials now attend me,</p>
<p>Trials never more annoy.</p>
<p>"Blest there with a weight of glory,</p>
<p>Still the path I'll ne'er forget,</p>
<p>But, exulting, cry, it led me</p>
<p>To my blessed Saviour's seat."</p>

<p>This teaches us that the comfort obtained by a one may often prove erviceable to another; just as wells would be used by the company who ame after. We read some book full of consolation, which is like onathan's rod, dropping with honey. Ah! we think our brother has been ere before us, and digged this well for us as well as for himself. any a "Night of Weeping," "Midnight Harmonies," an "Eternal Day," "A rook in the Lot," a "Comfort for Mourners," has been a well digged by  pilgrim for himself, but has proved quite as useful to others. pecially we notice this in the Psalms, such as that beginning, "Why rt thou cast down, O my soul?" Travellers have been delighted to see he footprint of man on a barren shore, and we love to see the waymarks f pilgrims while passing through the vale of tears.</p>
<p>The pilgrims dig the well, but, strange enough, it fills from the top nstead of the bottom. We use the means, but the blessing does not pring from the means. We dig a well, but heaven fills it with rain. he horse is prepared against the day of battle, but safety is of the ord. The means are connected with the end, but they do not of hemselves produce it. See here the rain fills the pools, so that the ells become useful as reservoirs for the water; labour is not lost, ut yet it does not supersede divine help.</p>
<p>Grace may well be compared to rain for its purity, for its refreshing nd vivifying influence, for its coming alone from above, and for the overeignty with which it is given or withheld. May our readers have howers of blessing, and may the wells they have digged be filled with ater! Oh, what are means and ordinances without the smile of heaven! hey are as clouds without rain, and pools without water. O God of ove, open the windows of heaven and pour us out a blessing!</p>

<p>"This Man receiveth sinners"; not, however, that they may remain inners, but he receives them that he may pardon their sins, justify heir persons, cleanse their hearts by his purifying word, preserve heir souls by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, and enable them to erve him, to show forth his praise, and to have communion with him. nto his heart's love he receives sinners, takes them from the unghill, and wears them as jewels in his crown; plucks them as brands rom the burning, and preserves them as costly monuments of his mercy. one are so precious in Jesus' sight as the sinners for whom he died. hen Jesus receives sinners, he has not some out-of-doors reception lace, no casual ward where he charitably entertains them as men do assing beggars, but he opens the golden gates of his royal heart, and eceives the sinner right into himself--yea, he admits the humble enitent into personal union and makes him a member of his body, of his lesh, and of his bones.

<p>Jesus was the Lord High Admiral of the sea that night, and his presence reserved the whole convoy. It is well to sail with Jesus, even though t be in a little ship. When we sail in Christ's company, we may not ake sure of fair weather, for great storms may toss the vessel which arries the Lord himself, and we must not expect to find the sea less oisterous around our little boat. If we go with Jesus we must be ontent to fare as he fares; and when the waves are rough to him, they ill be rough to us. It is by tempest and tossing that we shall come to and, as he did before us.</p>
<p>When the storm swept over Galilee's dark lake all faces gathered lackness, and all hearts dreaded shipwreck. When all creature help was seless, the slumbering Saviour arose, and with a word, transformed the iot of the tempest into the deep quiet of a calm; then were the little essels at rest as well as that which carried the Lord. Jesus is the tar of the sea; and though there be sorrow upon the sea, when Jesus is n it there is joy too. May our hearts make Jesus their anchor, their udder, their lighthouse, their life-boat, and their harbour. His hurch is the Admiral's flagship, let us attend her movements, and heer her officers with our presence. He himself is the great ttraction; let us follow ever in his wake, mark his signals, steer by is chart, and never fear while he is within hail. Not one ship in the onvoy shall suffer wreck; the great Commodore will steer every barque n safety to the desired haven. By faith we will slip our cable for nother day's cruise, and sail forth with Jesus into a sea of ribulation. Winds and waves will not spare us, but they all obey him; nd, therefore, whatever squalls may occur without, faith shall feel a lessed calm within. He is ever in the centre of the weather-beaten ompany: let us rejoice in him. His vessel has reached the haven, and o shall ours.</p>

<p>David's grief for sin was bitter. Its effects were visible upon his utward frame: "his bones waxed old"; "his moisture was turned into the rought of summer." No remedy could he find, until he made a full onfession before the throne of the heavenly grace. He tells us that or a time he kept silence, and his heart became more and more filled ith grief: like a mountain tarn whose outlet is blocked up, his soul as swollen with torrents of sorrow. He fashioned excuses; he ndeavoured to divert his thoughts, but it was all to no purpose; like  festering sore his anguish gathered, and as he would not use the ancet of confession, his spirit was full of torment, and knew no rest. t last it came to this, that he must return unto his God in humble enitence, or die outright; so he hastened to the mercy-seat, and there nrolled the volume of his iniquities before the all-seeing One, cknowledging all the evil of his ways in language such as you read in he fifty-first and other penitential Psalms. Having done this, a work o simple and yet so difficult to pride, he received at once the token f divine forgiveness; the bones which had been broken were made to ejoice, and he came forth from his closet to sing the blessedness of he man whose transgression is forgiven. See the value of a race-wrought confession of sin! It is to be prized above all price, or in every case where there is a genuine, gracious confession, mercy s freely given, not because the repentance and confession deserve ercy, but for Christ's sake. Blessed be God, there is always healing or the broken heart; the fountain is ever flowing to cleanse us from ur sins. Truly, O Lord, thou art a God "ready to pardon!" Therefore ill we acknowledge our iniquities.</p>

<p>Christian, you ought not to dread the arrival of evil tidings; because f you are distressed by them, what do you more than other men? Other en have not your God to fly to; they have never proved his aithfulness as you have done, and it is no wonder if they are bowed own with alarm and cowed with fear: but you profess to be of another pirit; you have been begotten again unto a lively hope, and your heart ives in heaven and not on earthly things; now, if you are seen to be istracted as other men, what is the value of that grace which you rofess to have received? Where is the dignity of that new nature which ou claim to possess?</p>
<p>Again, if you should be filled with alarm, as others are, you would, oubtless, be led into the sins so common to others under trying ircumstances. The ungodly, when they are overtaken by evil tidings, ebel against God; they murmur, and think that God deals hardly with hem. Will you fall into that same sin? Will you provoke the Lord as hey do?</p>
<p>Moreover, unconverted men often run to wrong means in order to escape rom difficulties, and you will be sure to do the same if your mind ields to the present pressure. Trust in the Lord, and wait patiently or him. Your wisest course is to do as Moses did at the Red Sea, "Stand still and see the salvation of God." For if you give way to fear hen you hear of evil tidings, you will be unable to meet the trouble ith that calm composure which nerves for duty, and sustains under dversity. How can you glorify God if you play the coward? Saints have ften sung God's high praises in the fires, but will your doubting and esponding, as if you had none to help you, magnify the Most High? Then ake courage, and relying in sure confidence upon the faithfulness of our covenant God, "let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fraid."</p>

<div class="response">
<p>The dispensation of the old covenant was that of distance. When God ppeared even to his servant Moses, he said, "Draw not nigh hither: put ff thy shoes from off thy feet"; and when he manifested himself upon ount Sinai, to his own chosen and separated people, one of the first ommands was, "Thou shalt set bounds about the mount." Both in the acred worship of the tabernacle and the temple, the thought of istance was always prominent. The mass of the people did not even nter the outer court. Into the inner court none but the priests might are to intrude; while into the innermost place, or the holy of holies, he high priest entered but once in the year. It was as if the Lord in hose early ages would teach man that sin was so utterly loathsome to im, that he must treat men as lepers put without the camp; and when he ame nearest to them, he yet made them feel the width of the separation etween a holy God and an impure sinner. When the gospel came, we were laced on quite another footing. The word "Go" was exchanged for "Come"; distance was made to give place to nearness, and we who foretime were afar off, were made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ. ncarnate Deity has no wall of fire about it. "Come unto me, all ye hat labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," is the oyful proclamation of God as he appears in human flesh. Not now does e teach the leper his leprosy by setting him at a distance, but by imself suffering the penalty of his defilement. What a state of safety nd privilege is this nearness to God through Jesus! Do you know it by xperience? If you know it, are you living in the power of it? arvellous is this nearness, yet it is to be followed by a dispensation f greater nearness still, when it shall be said, "The tabernacle of od is with men, and he doth dwell among them." Hasten it, O Lord.</p>

<p>To be a partaker of the divine nature is not, of course, to become God. hat cannot be. The essence of Deity is not to be participated in by he creature. Between the creature and the Creator there must ever be a ulf fixed in respect of essence; but as the first man Adam was made in he image of God, so we, by the renewal of the Holy Spirit, are in a et diviner sense made in the image of the Most High, and are partakers f the divine nature. We are, by grace, made like God. "God is love"; e become love--"He that loveth is born of God." God is truth; we ecome true, and we love that which is true: God is good, and he makes s good by his grace, so that we become the pure in heart who shall see od. Moreover, we become partakers of the divine nature in even a igher sense than this--in fact, in as lofty a sense as can be onceived, short of our being absolutely divine. Do we not become embers of the body of the divine person of Christ? Yes, the same blood hich flows in the head flows in the hand: and the same life which uickens Christ quickens his people, for "Ye are dead, and your life is id with Christ in God." Nay, as if this were not enough, we are arried unto Christ. He hath betrothed us unto himself in righteousness nd in faithfulness, and he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. h! marvellous mystery! we look into it, but who shall understand it? ne with Jesus--so one with him that the branch is not more one with he vine than we are a part of the Lord, our Saviour, and our Redeemer! hile we rejoice in this, let us remember that those who are made artakers of the divine nature will manifest their high and holy elationship in their intercourse with others, and make it evident by heir daily walk and conversation that they have escaped the corruption hat is in the world through lust.

<p>This was a strange question for Job to ask of the Lord.

The nquiry was natural from one surrounded with such insupportable iseries, but after all, it is capable of a very humbling answer. It is rue man is not the sea, but he is even more troublesome and unruly. he sea obediently respects its boundary, and though it be but a belt f sand, it does not overleap the limit. Mighty as it is, it hears the ivine hitherto, and when most raging with tempest it respects the ord; but self-willed man defies heaven and oppresses earth, neither is here any end to this rebellious rage. The sea, obedient to the moon, bbs and flows with ceaseless regularity, and thus renders an active as ell as a passive obedience; but man, restless beyond his sphere, leeps within the lines of duty, indolent where he should be active. He ill neither come nor go at the divine command, but sullenly prefers to o what he should not, and to leave undone that which is required of im. Every drop in the ocean, every beaded bubble, and every yeasty oam-flake, every shell and pebble, feel the power of law, and yield or ove at once. O that our nature were but one thousandth part as much onformed to the will of God! We call the sea fickle and false, but how onstant it is! Since our fathers' days, and the old time before them, he sea is where it was, beating on the same cliffs to the same tune; e know where to find it, it forsakes not its bed, and changes not in ts ceaseless boom; but where is man-vain, fickle man?

Sin s there, let our prayers begin to attack it. Our cries for our ffspring should precede those cries which betoken their actual advent nto a world of sin. In the days of their youth we shall see sad tokens f that dumb and deaf spirit which will neither pray aright, nor hear he voice of God in the soul, but Jesus still commands, "Bring them nto me."

Woe unto those who seek after the one without he other!

We must have faith, for this is the oundation; we must have holiness of life, for this is the uperstructure. Of what service is the mere foundation of a building to  man in the day of tempest? Can he hide himself therein? He wants a ouse to cover him, as well as a foundation for that house. Even so we eed the superstructure of spiritual life if we would have comfort in he day of doubt. But seek not a holy life without faith, for that ould be to erect a house which can afford no permanent shelter, ecause it has no foundation on a rock. Let faith and life be put ogether, and, like the two abutments of an arch, they will make our iety enduring. Like light and heat streaming from the same sun, they re alike full of blessing.

When we can name our blessings Samuel, that is, "asked of od," they will be as dear to us as her child was to Hannah. Peninnah ad many children, but they came as common blessings unsought in rayer: Hannah's one heaven-given child was dearer far, because he was he fruit of earnest pleadings. How sweet was that water to Samson hich he found at "the well of him that prayed!" Quassia cups turn all aters bitter, but the cup of prayer puts a sweetness into the draughts t brings. Did we pray for the conversion of our children? How doubly weet, when they are saved, to see in them our own petitions fulfilled! etter to rejoice over them as the fruit of our pleadings than as the ruit of our bodies. Have we sought of the Lord some choice spiritual ift? When it comes to us it will be wrapped up in the gold cloth of od's faithfulness and truth, and so be doubly precious. Have we etitioned for success in the Lord's work? How joyful is the prosperity hich comes flying upon the wings of prayer! It is always best to get lessings into our house in the legitimate way, by the door of prayer; hen they are blessings indeed, and not temptations. Even when prayer peeds not, the blessings grow all the richer for the delay; the child esus was all the more lovely in the eyes of Mary when she found him fter having sought him sorrowing. That which we win by prayer we hould dedicate to God, as Hannah dedicated Samuel. The gift came from eaven, let it go to heaven. Prayer brought it, gratitude sang over it, et devotion consecrate it.

<p>Gideon ordered his men to do two things: covering up a torch in an arthen pitcher, he bade them, at an appointed signal, break the itcher and let the light shine, and then sound with the trumpet, rying, "The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon! the sword of the Lord, nd of Gideon!" This is precisely what all Christians must do. First, ou must shine; break the pitcher which conceals your light; throw side the bushel which has been hiding your candle, and shine. Let your ight shine before men; let your good works be such, that when men look pon you, they shall know that you have been with Jesus. Then there ust be the sound, the blowing of the trumpet. There must be active xertions for the ingathering of sinners by proclaiming Christ rucified. Take the gospel to them; carry it to their door; put it in heir way; do not suffer them to escape it; blow the trumpet right gainst their ears. Remember that the true war-cry of the Church is ideon's watchword, "The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon!" God must do t, it is his own work. But we are not to be idle; instrumentality is o be used--"The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon!" If we only cry, "The sword of the Lord!" we shall be guilty of an idle presumption; and f we shout, "The sword of Gideon!" alone, we shall manifest idolatrous eliance on an arm of flesh: we must blend the two in practical armony, "The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon!" We can do nothing of urselves, but we can do everything by the help of our God; let us, herefore, in his name determine to go out personally and serve with ur flaming torch of holy example, and with our trumpet tones of arnest declaration and testimony, and God shall be with us, and Midian hall be put to confusion, and the Lord of hosts shall reign forever nd ever.</p>

<p>How heart-cheering to the believer is the delight which God has in his aints! We cannot see any reason in ourselves why the Lord should take leasure in us; we cannot take delight in ourselves, for we often have o groan, being burdened; conscious of our sinfulness, and deploring ur unfaithfulness; and we fear that God's people cannot take much elight in us, for they must perceive so much of our imperfections and ur follies, that they may rather lament our infirmities than admire ur graces. But we love to dwell upon this transcendent truth, this lorious mystery: that as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so oes the Lord rejoice over us. We do not read anywhere that God elighteth in the cloud-capped mountains, or the sparkling stars, but e do read that he delighteth in the habitable parts of the earth, and hat his delights are with the sons of men. We do not find it written hat even angels give his soul delight; nor doth he say, concerning herubim and seraphim, "Thou shalt be called Hephzibah, for the Lord elighteth in thee"; but he does say all that to poor fallen creatures ike ourselves, debased and depraved by sin, but saved, exalted, and lorified by his grace. In what strong language he expresses his elight in his people! Who could have conceived of the eternal One as ursting forth into a song? Yet it is written, "He will rejoice over hee with joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with inging." As he looked upon the world he had made, he said, "It is very ood"; but when he beheld those who are the purchase of Jesus' blood, is own chosen ones, it seemed as if the great heart of the Infinite ould restrain itself no longer, but overflowed in divine exclamations f joy. Should not we utter our grateful response to such a marvellous eclaration of his love, and sing, "I will rejoice in the Lord, I will oy in the God of my salvation?"</p>

<p>Fear made David pray thus, for something whispered, "Perhaps, after ll, thou mayst be gathered with the wicked." That fear, although arred by unbelief, springs, in the main, from holy anxiety, arising rom the recollection of past sin. Even the pardoned man will enquire, "What if at the end my sins should be remembered, and I should be left ut of the catalogue of the saved?" He recollects his present nfruitfulness--so little grace, so little love, so little holiness, nd looking forward to the future, he considers his weakness and the any temptations which beset him, and he fears that he may fall, and ecome a prey to the enemy. A sense of sin and present evil, and his revailing corruptions, compel him to pray, in fear and trembling,</p>
<p>"Gather not my soul with sinners." Reader, if you have prayed this rayer, and if your character be rightly described in the Psalm from hich it is taken, you need not be afraid that you shall be gathered ith sinners. Have you the two virtues which David had--the outward alking in integrity, and the inward trusting in the Lord? Are you esting upon Christ's sacrifice, and can you compass the altar of God ith humble hope? If so, rest assured, with the wicked you never shall e gathered, for that calamity is impossible. The gathering at the udgment is like to like. "Gather ye together first the tares, and bind hem in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn." If, hen, thou art like God's people, thou shalt be with God's people. You annot be gathered with the wicked, for you are too dearly bought. edeemed by the blood of Christ, you are his forever, and where he is, here must his people be. You are loved too much to be cast away with eprobates. Shall one dear to Christ perish? Impossible! Hell cannot old thee! Heaven claims thee! Trust in thy Surety and fear not!</p>

<p>Be glad of heart, O believer, but take care that thy gladness has its pring in the Lord. Thou hast much cause for gladness in thy God, for hou canst sing with David, "God, my exceeding joy." Be glad that the ord reigneth, that Jehovah is King! Rejoice that he sits upon the hrone, and ruleth all things! Every attribute of God should become a resh ray in the sunlight of our gladness. That he is wise should make s glad, knowing as we do our own foolishness. That he is mighty, hould cause us to rejoice who tremble at our weakness. That he is verlasting, should always be a theme of joy when we know that we ither as the grass. That he is unchanging, should perpetually yield us  song, since we change every hour. That he is full of grace, that he s overflowing with it, and that this grace in covenant he has given to s; that it is ours to cleanse us, ours to keep us, ours to sanctify s, ours to perfect us, ours to bring us to glory--all this should tend o make us glad in him. This gladness in God is as a deep river; we ave only as yet touched its brink, we know a little of its clear weet, heavenly streams, but onward the depth is greater, and the urrent more impetuous in its joy. The Christian feels that he may elight himself not only in what God is, but also in all that God has one in the past. The Psalms show us that God's people in olden times ere wont to think much of God's actions, and to have a song concerning ach of them. So let God's people now rehearse the deeds of the Lord! et them tell of his mighty acts, and "sing unto the Lord, for he hath riumphed gloriously." Nor let them ever cease to sing, for as new ercies flow to them day by day, so should their gladness in the Lord's oving acts in providence and in grace show itself in continued hanksgiving.

<p>Most of us know what it is to be overwhelmed in heart; emptied as when  man wipeth a dish and turneth it upside down; submerged and thrown on ur beam ends like a vessel mastered by the storm. Discoveries of nward corruption will do this, if the Lord permits the great deep of ur depravity to become troubled and cast up mire and dirt. isappointments and heart-breaks will do this when billow after billow olls over us, and we are like a broken shell hurled to and fro by the urf. Blessed be God, at such seasons we are not without an ll-sufficient solace, our God is the harbour of weather-beaten sails, he hospice of forlorn pilgrims. Higher than we are is he, his mercy igher than our sins, his love higher than our thoughts. It is pitiful o see men putting their trust in something lower than themselves; but ur confidence is fixed upon an exceeding high and glorious Lord. A ock he is since he changes not, and a high Rock, because the tempests hich overwhelm us roll far beneath at his feet; he is not disturbed by hem, but rules them at his will. If we get under the shelter of this ofty Rock we may defy the hurricane; all is calm under the lee of that owering cliff. Alas! such is the confusion in which the troubled mind s often cast, that we need piloting to this divine shelter. Hence the rayer of the text. O Lord, our God, by thy Holy Spirit, teach us the ay of faith, lead us into thy rest. The wind blows us out to sea, the elm answers not to our puny hand; thou, thou alone canst steer us over he bar between yon sunken rocks, safe into the fair haven. How ependent we are upon thee--we need thee to bring us to thee. To be isely directed and steered into safety and peace is thy gift, and hine alone. This night be pleased to deal well with thy servants.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>What a state of privilege! It includes our justification before God, ut the term "acceptance" in the Greek means more than that. It ignifies that we are the objects of divine complacence, nay, even of ivine delight. How marvellous that we, worms, mortals, sinners, should e the objects of divine love! But it is only "in the beloved." Some hristians seem to be accepted in their own experience, at least, that s their apprehension. When their spirit is lively, and their hopes right, they think God accepts them, for they feel so high, so eavenly-minded, so drawn above the earth! But when their souls cleave o the dust, they are the victims of the fear that they are no longer ccepted. If they could but see that all their high joys do not exalt hem, and all their low despondencies do not really depress them in heir Father's sight, but that they stand accepted in One who never lters, in One who is always the beloved of God, always perfect, always ithout spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, how much happier they would e, and how much more they would honour the Saviour! Rejoice then, eliever, in this: thou art accepted "in the beloved." Thou lookest ithin, and thou sayest, "There is nothing acceptable here!" But look t Christ, and see if there is not everything acceptable there. Thy ins trouble thee; but God has cast thy sins behind his back, and thou rt accepted in the Righteous One. Thou hast to fight with corruption, nd to wrestle with temptation, but thou art already accepted in him ho has overcome the powers of evil. The devil tempts thee; be of good heer, he cannot destroy thee, for thou art accepted in him who has roken Satan's head. Know by full assurance thy glorious standing. Even lorified souls are not more accepted than thou art. They are only ccepted in heaven "in the beloved," and thou art even now accepted in hrist after the same manner.</p>

<p>A certain man had a demoniac son, who was afflicted with a dumb spirit. he father, having seen the futility of the endeavours of the disciples o heal his child, had little or no faith in Christ, and therefore, hen he was bidden to bring his son to him, he said to Jesus, "If thou anst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us." Now there was n "if" in the question, but the poor trembling father had put the "if" in the wrong place: Jesus Christ, therefore, without commanding him to etract the "if," kindly puts it in its legitimate position. "Nay, erily," he seemed to say, "there should be no if' about my power, nor oncerning my willingness, the if' lies somewhere else." "If thou canst elieve, all things are possible to him that believeth." The man's rust was strengthened, he offered a humble prayer for an increase of aith, and instantly Jesus spoke the word, and the devil was cast out, ith an injunction never to return. There is a lesson here which we eed to learn. We, like this man, often see that there is an "if" somewhere, but we are perpetually blundering by putting it in the wrong lace. "If" Jesus can help me--"if" he can give me grace to overcome emptation--"if" he can give me pardon--"if" he can make me successful? ay, "if" you can believe, he both can and will. You have misplaced our "if." If you can confidently trust, even as all things are ossible to Christ, so shall all things be possible to you. Faith tandeth in God's power, and is robed in God's majesty; it weareth the oyal apparel, and rideth on the King's horse, for it is the grace hich the King delighteth to honour. Girding itself with the glorious ight of the all-working Spirit, it becomes, in the omnipotence of God, ighty to do, to dare, and to suffer. All things, without limit, are ossible to him that believeth. My soul, canst thou believe thy Lord onight?</p>

<p>Paradoxes abound in Christian experience, and here is one--the spouse as asleep, and yet she was awake. He only can read the believer's iddle who has ploughed with the heifer of his experience. The two oints in this evening's text are--a mournful sleepiness and a hopeful akefulness. I sleep. Through sin that dwelleth in us we may become lax n holy duties, slothful in religious exercises, dull in spiritual oys, and altogether supine and careless. This is a shameful state for ne in whom the quickening Spirit dwells; and it is dangerous to the ighest degree. Even wise virgins sometimes slumber, but it is high ime for all to shake off the bands of sloth. It is to be feared that any believers lose their strength as Samson lost his locks, while leeping on the lap of carnal security. With a perishing world around s, to sleep is cruel; with eternity so near at hand, it is madness. et we are none of us so much awake as we should be; a few hunder-claps would do us all good, and it may be, unless we soon estir ourselves, we shall have them in the form of war, or pestilence, r personal bereavements and losses. O that we may leave forever the ouch of fleshly ease, and go forth with flaming torches to meet the oming Bridegroom! My heart waketh. This is a happy sign. Life is not xtinct, though sadly smothered. When our renewed heart struggles gainst our natural heaviness, we should be grateful to sovereign grace or keeping a little vitality within the body of this death.

<p>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God. Conscience accuses no onger. Judgment now decides for the sinner instead of against him. emory looks back upon past sins, with deep sorrow for the sin, but yet ith no dread of any penalty to come; for Christ has paid the debt of is people to the last jot and tittle, and received the divine receipt; nd unless God can be so unjust as to demand double payment for one ebt, no soul for whom Jesus died as a substitute can ever be cast into ell. It seems to be one of the very principles of our enlightened ature to believe that God is just; we feel that it must be so, and his gives us our terror at first; but is it not marvellous that this ery same belief that God is just, becomes afterwards the pillar of our onfidence and peace! If God be just, I, a sinner, alone and without a ubstitute, must be punished; but Jesus stands in my stead and is unished for me; and now, if God be just, I, a sinner, standing in hrist, can never be punished. God must change his nature before one oul, for whom Jesus was a substitute, can ever by any possibility uffer the lash of the law. Therefore, Jesus having taken the place of he believer--having rendered a full equivalent to divine wrath for all hat his people ought to have suffered as the result of sin, the eliever can shout with glorious triumph, "Who shall lay anything to he charge of God's elect?" Not God, for he hath justified; not Christ, or he hath died, "yea rather hath risen again." My hope lives not ecause I am not a sinner, but because I am a sinner for whom Christ ied; my trust is not that I am holy, but that being unholy, he is my ighteousness. My faith rests not upon what I am, or shall be, or feel, r know, but in what Christ is, in what he has done, and in what he is ow doing for me.

The temptation with a man of refined thought and high ducation is to depart from the simple truth of Christ crucified, and o invent, as the term is, a more intellectual doctrine.

This is the root of Neology, and the other fine hings which in days gone by were so fashionable in Germany, and are ow so ensnaring to certain classes of divines. Whoever you are, good eader, and whatever your education may be, if you be the Lord's, be ssured you will find no rest in philosophizing divinity.

Jesus satisfies the most elevated intellect when he is elievingly received, but apart from him the mind of the regenerate iscovers no rest. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of nowledge." "A good understanding have all they that do his ommandments."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The myrtle trees that were in the bottom.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Zechariah</span> <span class="chapter">1</span>:<span class="verse">8</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>The vision in this chapter describes the condition of Israel in echariah's day; but being interpreted in its aspect towards us, it escribes the Church of God as we find it now in the world. The Church s compared to a myrtle grove flourishing in a valley. It is hidden, nobserved, secreted; courting no honour and attracting no observation rom the careless gazer. The Church, like her head, has a glory, but it s concealed from carnal eyes, for the time of her breaking forth in ll her splendour is not yet come. The idea of tranquil security is lso suggested to us: for the myrtle grove in the valley is still and alm, while the storm sweeps over the mountain summits. Tempests spend heir force upon the craggy peaks of the Alps, but down yonder where lows the stream which maketh glad the city of our God, the myrtles lourish by the still waters, all unshaken by the impetuous wind. How reat is the inward tranquility of God's Church! Even when opposed and ersecuted, she has a peace which the world gives not, and which, herefore, it cannot take away: the peace of God which passeth all nderstanding keeps the hearts and minds of God's people. Does not the etaphor forcibly picture the peaceful, perpetual growth of the saints? he myrtle sheds not her leaves, she is always green; and the Church in er worst time still hath a blessed verdure of grace about her; nay, he has sometimes exhibited most verdure when her winter has been harpest. She has prospered most when her adversities have been most evere. Hence the text hints at victory. The myrtle is the emblem of eace, and a significant token of triumph. The brows of conquerors were ound with myrtle and with laurel; and is not the Church ever ictorious? Is not every Christian more than a conqueror through him hat loved him? Living in peace, do not the saints fall asleep in the rms of victory?</p>

Since that time, whether your path has been rough ith troubles, or smooth with mercies, it has been full of proofs that ou are a man greatly beloved. If the Lord has chastened you, yet not n anger; if he has made you poor, yet in grace you have been rich. The ore unworthy you feel yourself to be, the more evidence have you that othing but unspeakable love could have led the Lord Jesus to save such  soul as yours. The more demerit you feel, the clearer is the display f the abounding love of God in having chosen you, and called you, and ade you an heir of bliss. Now, if there be such love between God and s let us live in the influence and sweetness of it, and use the rivilege of our position. Do not let us approach our Lord as though we ere strangers, or as though he were unwilling to hear us--for we are reatly beloved by our loving Father. "He that spared not his own Son, ut delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely ive us all things?" Come boldly, O believer, for despite the hisperings of Satan and the doubtings of thine own heart, thou art reatly beloved. Meditate on the exceeding greatness and faithfulness f divine love this evening, and so go to thy bed in peace.</p>

<p>It is a common-place thought, and yet it tastes like nectar to the eary heart--Jesus was tempted as I am. You have heard that truth many imes: have you grasped it?

It is a sharp fight which you are waging, but Jesus has stood oot to foot with the same enemy. Let us be of good cheer, Christ has orne the load before us, and the blood-stained footsteps of the King f glory may be seen along the road which we traverse at this hour. here is something sweeter yet--Jesus was tempted, but Jesus never inned. Then, my soul, it is not needful for thee to sin, for Jesus was  man, and if one man endured these temptations and sinned not, then in is power his members may also cease from sin. Some beginners in the ivine life think that they cannot be tempted without sinning, but they istake; there is no sin in being tempted, but there is sin in yielding o temptation. Herein is comfort for the sorely tempted ones. There is till more to encourage them if they reflect that the Lord Jesus, hough tempted, gloriously triumphed, and as he overcame, so surely hall his followers also, for Jesus is the representative man for his eople; the Head has triumphed, and the members share in the victory. ears are needless, for Christ is with us, armed for our defence. Our lace of safety is the bosom of the Saviour. Perhaps we are tempted ust now, in order to drive us nearer to him. Blessed be any wind that lows us into the port of our Saviour's love! Happy wounds, which make s seek the beloved Physician. Ye tempted ones, come to your tempted aviour, for he can be touched with a feeling of your infirmities, and ill succour every tried and tempted one.</p>

From the altar of age the flashes f the fire of youth are gone, but the more real flame of earnest eeling remains.

All the in that a believer ever did, or can be allowed to commit, cannot estroy his interest in the Lord Jesus Christ, as his advocate. The ame here given to our Lord is suggestive. "Jesus." Ah! then he is an dvocate such as we need, for Jesus is the name of one whose business nd delight it is to save. "They shall call his name Jesus, for he hall save his people from their sins." His sweetest name implies his uccess. Next, it is "Jesus Christ"--Christos, the anointed. This shows is authority to plead. The Christ has a right to plead, for he is the ather's own appointed advocate and elected priest. If he were of our hoosing he might fail, but if God hath laid help upon one that is ighty, we may safely lay our trouble where God has laid his help. He s Christ, and therefore authorized; he is Christ, and therefore ualified, for the anointing has fully fitted him for his work. He can lead so as to move the heart of God and prevail. What words of enderness, what sentences of persuasion will the anointed use when he tands up to plead for me! One more letter of his name remains, "Jesus hrist the righteous." This is not only his character but his plea. It s his character, and if the Righteous One be my advocate, then my ause is good, or he would not have espoused it. It is his plea, for he eets the charge of unrighteousness against me by the plea that he is ighteous. He declares himself my substitute and puts his obedience to y account.

<p>Mr. MacDonald asked the inhabitants of the island of St. Kilda how a an must be saved. An old man replied, "We shall be saved if we repent, nd forsake our sins, and turn to God." "Yes," said a middle-aged emale, "and with a true heart too." "Aye," rejoined a third, "and with rayer"; and, added a fourth, "It must be the prayer of the heart." "And we must be diligent too," said a fifth, "in keeping the ommandments." Thus, each having contributed his mite, feeling that a ery decent creed had been made up, they all looked and listened for he preacher's approbation, but they had aroused his deepest pity. The arnal mind always maps out for itself a way in which self can work and ecome great, but the Lord's way is quite the reverse. Believing and eing baptized are no matters of merit to be gloried in--they are so imple that boasting is excluded, and free grace bears the palm. It may e that the reader is unsaved--what is the reason? Do you think the way f salvation as laid down in the text to be dubious? How can that be hen God has pledged his own word for its certainty? Do you think it oo easy? Why, then, do you not attend to it? Its ease leaves those ithout excuse who neglect it. To believe is simply to trust, to epend, to rely upon Christ Jesus. To be baptized is to submit to the rdinance which our Lord fulfilled at Jordan, to which the converted nes submitted at Pentecost, to which the jailer yielded obedience the ery night of his conversion. The outward sign saves not, but it sets orth to us our death, burial, and resurrection with Jesus, and, like he Lord's Supper, is not to be neglected. Reader, do you believe in esus? Then, dear friend, dismiss your fears, you shall be saved. Are ou still an unbeliever, then remember there is but one door, and if ou will not enter by it you will perish in your sins.</p>

<p>He who is a believer in Jesus finds enough in his Lord to satisfy him ow, and to content him for evermore.

Put him in a dungeon and he will find good company; place him in  barren wilderness, he will eat the bread of heaven; drive him away rom friendship, he will meet the "friend that sticketh closer than a rother."

<p>Strange choice of Moses, but how much more strange the choice of him ho is a prophet like unto Moses, and greater than he! Our Lord, who is air as the lily, has entered into marriage union with one who onfesses herself to be black, because the sun has looked upon her. It s the wonder of angels that the love of Jesus should be set upon poor, ost, guilty men. Each believer must, when filled with a sense of esus' love, be also overwhelmed with astonishment that such love hould be lavished on an object so utterly unworthy of it. Knowing as e do our secret guiltiness, unfaithfulness, and black-heartedness, we re dissolved in grateful admiration of the matchless freeness and overeignty of grace. Jesus must have found the cause of his love in is own heart, he could not have found it in us, for it is not there. ven since our conversion we have been black, though grace has made us omely. Holy Rutherford said of himself what we must each subscribe o--"His relation to me is, that I am sick, and he is the Physician of hom I stand in need. Alas! how often I play fast and loose with hrist! He bindeth, I loose; he buildeth, I cast down; I quarrel with hrist, and he agreeth with me twenty times a day!" Most tender and aithful Husband of our souls, pursue thy gracious work of conforming s to thine image, till thou shalt present even us poor Ethiopians unto hyself, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. Moses met with pposition because of his marriage, and both himself and his spouse ere the subjects of an evil eye. Can we wonder if this vain world pposes Jesus and his spouse, and especially when great sinners are onverted? for this is ever the Pharisee's ground of objection, "This an receiveth sinners." Still is the old cause of quarrel revived, "Because he had married an Ethiopian woman."</p>

<p>Our heavenly Father sends us frequent troubles to try our faith. If our aith be worth anything, it will stand the test. Gilt is afraid of ire, but gold is not: the paste gem dreads to be touched by the iamond, but the true jewel fears no test. It is a poor faith which can nly trust God when friends are true, the body full of health, and the usiness profitable; but that is true faith which holds by the Lord's aithfulness when friends are gone, when the body is sick, when spirits re depressed, and the light of our Father's countenance is hidden. A aith which can say, in the direst trouble, "Though he slay me, yet ill I trust in him," is heaven-born faith. The Lord afflicts his ervants to glorify himself, for he is greatly glorified in the graces f his people, which are his own handiwork. When "tribulation worketh atience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope," the Lord is onoured by these growing virtues. We should never know the music of he harp if the strings were left untouched; nor enjoy the juice of the rape if it were not trodden in the winepress; nor discover the sweet erfume of cinnamon if it were not pressed and beaten; nor feel the armth of fire if the coals were not utterly consumed. The wisdom and ower of the great Workman are discovered by the trials through which is vessels of mercy are permitted to pass. Present afflictions tend lso to heighten future joy.

<p>We learn from this narrative, the necessity of human agency.

So in the saving of souls, God worketh by means; and while he present economy of grace shall stand, God will be pleased by the oolishness of preaching to save them that believe. When God worketh ithout instruments, doubtless he is glorified; but he hath himself elected the plan of instrumentality as being that by which he is most agnified in the earth. Means of themselves are utterly unavailing. "Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing." What was he reason of this? Were they not fishermen plying their special alling? Verily, they were no raw hands; they understood the work. Had hey gone about the toil unskilfully? No. Had they lacked industry? No, hey had toiled. Had they lacked perseverance? No, they had toiled all he night. Was there a deficiency of fish in the sea? Certainly not, or as soon as the Master came, they swam to the net in shoals. What, hen, is the reason? Is it because there is no power in the means of hemselves apart from the presence of Jesus? "Without him we can do othing." But with Christ we can do all things. Christ's presence onfers success. Jesus sat in Peter's boat, and his will, by a ysterious influence, drew the fish to the net. When Jesus is lifted up n his Church, his presence is the Church's power--the shout of a king s in the midst of her. "I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto e." Let us go out this morning on our work of soul fishing, looking up n faith, and around us in solemn anxiety.

<p>Mark the grand characteristic of true prayer--"In the Holy Ghost." The eed of acceptable devotion must come from heaven's storehouse. Only he prayer which comes from God can go to God. We must shoot the Lord's rrows back to him. That desire which he writes upon our heart will ove his heart and bring down a blessing, but the desires of the flesh ave no power with him.</p>
<p>Praying in the Holy Ghost is praying in fervency. Cold prayers ask the ord not to hear them. Those who do not plead with fervency, plead not t all. As well speak of lukewarm fire as of lukewarm prayer--it is ssential that it be red hot. It is praying perseveringly. The true uppliant gathers force as he proceeds, and grows more fervent when God elays to answer. The longer the gate is closed, the more vehemently oes he use the knocker, and the longer the angel lingers the more esolved is he that he will never let him go without the blessing. eautiful in God's sight is tearful, agonizing, unconquerable mportunity. It means praying humbly, for the Holy Spirit never puffs s up with pride. It is his office to convince of sin, and so to bow us own in contrition and brokenness of spirit. We shall never sing Gloria n excelsis except we pray to God De profundis: out of the depths must e cry, or we shall never behold glory in the highest. It is loving rayer. Prayer should be perfumed with love, saturated with love--love o our fellow saints, and love to Christ. Moreover, it must be a prayer ull of faith. A man prevails only as he believes. The Holy Spirit is he author of faith, and strengthens it, so that we pray believing od's promise.

<p>Genuine seekers who as yet have not obtained the blessing, may take omfort from the story before us. The Saviour did not at once bestow he blessing, even though the woman had great faith in him. He intended o give it, but he waited awhile. "He answered her not a word." Were ot her prayers good? Never better in the world. Was not her case eedy? Sorrowfully needy. Did she not feel her need sufficiently? She elt it overwhelmingly. Was she not earnest enough? She was intensely o. Had she no faith? She had such a high degree of it that even Jesus ondered, and said, "O woman, great is thy faith." See then, although t is true that faith brings peace, yet it does not always bring it nstantaneously. There may be certain reasons calling for the trial of aith, rather than the reward of faith. Genuine faith may be in the oul like a hidden seed, but as yet it may not have budded and lossomed into joy and peace. A painful silence from the Saviour is the rievous trial of many a seeking soul, but heavier still is the ffliction of a harsh cutting reply such as this, "It is not meet to ake the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs." Many in waiting pon the Lord find immediate delight, but this is not the case with ll. Some, like the jailer, are in a moment turned from darkness to ight, but others are plants of slower growth. A deeper sense of sin ay be given to you instead of a sense of pardon, and in such a case ou will have need of patience to bear the heavy blow. Ah! poor heart, hough Christ beat and bruise thee, or even slay thee, trust him; hough he should give thee an angry word, believe in the love of his eart. Do not, I beseech thee, give up seeking or trusting my Master, ecause thou hast not yet obtained the conscious joy which thou longest or. Cast thyself on him, and perseveringly depend even where thou anst not rejoicingly hope.</p>

<p>Faultless before the presence of his glory.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Revolve in your mind that wondrous word, "faultless!" We are far off rom it now; but as our Lord never stops short of perfection in his ork of love, we shall reach it one day. The Saviour who will keep his eople to the end, will also present them at last to himself, as "a lorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but oly and without blemish." All the jewels in the Saviour's crown are of he first water and without a single flaw. All the maids of honour who ttend the Lamb's wife are pure virgins without spot or stain. But how ill Jesus make us faultless? He will wash us from our sins in his own lood until we are white and fair as God's purest angel; and we shall e clothed in his righteousness, that righteousness which makes the aint who wears it positively faultless; yea, perfect in the sight of od. We shall be unblameable and unreproveable even in his eyes. His aw will not only have no charge against us, but it will be magnified n us. Moreover, the work of the Holy Spirit within us will be ltogether complete. He will make us so perfectly holy, that we shall ave no lingering tendency to sin. Judgment, memory, will--every power nd passion shall be emancipated from the thraldom of evil. We shall be oly even as God is holy, and in his presence we shall dwell forever. aints will not be out of place in heaven, their beauty will be as reat as that of the place prepared for them. Oh the rapture of that our when the everlasting doors shall be lifted up, and we, being made eet for the inheritance, shall dwell with the saints in light. Sin one, Satan shut out, temptation past forever, and ourselves "faultless" before God, this will be heaven indeed! Let us be joyful ow as we rehearse the song of eternal praise so soon to roll forth in ull chorus from all the blood-washed host; let us copy David's xultings before the ark as a prelude to our ecstasies before the hrone.</p>

<p>Note the glorious personality of the promise. I will, I will. The Lord ehovah himself interposes to deliver and redeem his people. He pledges imself personally to rescue them. His own arm shall do it, that he may ave the glory. Here is not a word said of any effort of our own which ay be needed to assist the Lord. Neither our strength nor our weakness s taken into the account, but the lone I, like the sun in the heavens, hines out resplendent in all-sufficience. Why then do we calculate our orces, and consult with flesh and blood to our grievous wounding? ehovah has power enough without borrowing from our puny arm. Peace, ye nbelieving thoughts, be still, and know that the Lord reigneth. Nor is here a hint concerning secondary means and causes. The Lord says othing of friends and helpers: he undertakes the work alone, and feels o need of human arms to aid him. Vain are all our lookings around to ompanions and relatives; they are broken reeds if we lean upon hem--often unwilling when able, and unable when they are willing. ince the promise comes alone from God, it would be well to wait only pon him; and when we do so, our expectation never fails us. Who are he wicked that we should fear them? The Lord will utterly consume hem; they are to be pitied rather than feared. As for terrible ones, hey are only terrors to those who have no God to fly to, for when the ord is on our side, whom shall we fear? If we run into sin to please he wicked, we have cause to be alarmed, but if we hold fast our ntegrity, the rage of tyrants shall be overruled for our good. When he fish swallowed Jonah, he found him a morsel which he could not igest; and when the world devours the church, it is glad to be rid of t again. In all times of fiery trial, in patience let us possess our ouls.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>The act of prayer teaches us our unworthiness, which is a very salutary esson for such proud beings as we are. If God gave us favours without onstraining us to pray for them we should never know how poor we are, ut a true prayer is an inventory of wants, a catalogue of necessities,  revelation of hidden poverty. While it is an application to divine ealth, it is a confession of human emptiness. The most healthy state f a Christian is to be always empty in self and constantly depending pon the Lord for supplies; to be always poor in self and rich in esus; weak as water personally, but mighty through God to do great xploits; and hence the use of prayer, because, while it adores God, it ays the creature where it should be, in the very dust. Prayer is in tself, apart from the answer which it brings, a great benefit to the hristian. As the runner gains strength for the race by daily exercise, o for the great race of life we acquire energy by the hallowed labour f prayer. Prayer plumes the wings of God's young eaglets, that they ay learn to mount above the clouds. Prayer girds the loins of God's arriors, and sends them forth to combat with their sinews braced and heir muscles firm. An earnest pleader cometh out of his closet, even s the sun ariseth from the chambers of the east, rejoicing like a trong man to run his race. Prayer is that uplifted hand of Moses which outs the Amalekites more than the sword of Joshua; it is the arrow hot from the chamber of the prophet foreboding defeat to the Syrians. rayer girds human weakness with divine strength, turns human folly nto heavenly wisdom, and gives to troubled mortals the peace of God. e know not what prayer cannot do! We thank thee, great God, for the ercy-seat, a choice proof of thy marvellous lovingkindness. Help us to se it aright throughout this day!</p>

<div class="response">
<p>In the second epistle to Timothy, first chapter, and ninth verse, are hese words--"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling." Now, here is a touchstone by which we may try our calling. It is "an oly calling, not according to our works, but according to his own urpose and grace." This calling forbids all trust in our own doings, nd conducts us to Christ alone for salvation, but it afterwards purges s from dead works to serve the living and true God. As he that hath alled you is holy, so must you be holy. If you are living in sin, you re not called, but if you are truly Christ's, you can say, "Nothing ains me so much as sin; I desire to be rid of it; Lord, help me to be oly." Is this the panting of thy heart? Is this the tenor of thy life owards God, and his divine will? Again, in Philippians, 3:13, 14, we re told of "The high calling of God in Christ Jesus." Is then your alling a high calling? Has it ennobled your heart, and set it upon eavenly things? Has it elevated your hopes, your tastes, your desires? as it upraised the constant tenor of your life, so that you spend it ith God and for God? Another test we find in Hebrews 3:1--"Partakers f the heavenly calling." Heavenly calling means a call from heaven. If an alone call thee, thou art uncalled. Is thy calling of God? Is it a all to heaven as well as from heaven? Unless thou art a stranger here, nd heaven thy home, thou hast not been called with a heavenly calling; or those who have been so called, declare that they look for a city hich hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God, and they hemselves are strangers and pilgrims upon the earth. Is thy calling hus holy, high, heavenly? Then, beloved, thou hast been called of God, or such is the calling wherewith God doth call his people.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>There are times when solitude is better than society, and silence is iser than speech. We should be better Christians if we were more lone, waiting upon God, and gathering through meditation on his Word piritual strength for labour in his service. We ought to muse upon the hings of God, because we thus get the real nutriment out of them. ruth is something like the cluster of the vine: if we would have wine rom it, we must bruise it; we must press and squeeze it many times. he bruiser's feet must come down joyfully upon the bunches, or else he juice will not flow; and they must well tread the grapes, or else uch of the precious liquid will be wasted. So we must, by meditation, read the clusters of truth, if we would get the wine of consolation herefrom. Our bodies are not supported by merely taking food into the outh, but the process which really supplies the muscle, and the nerve, nd the sinew, and the bone, is the process of digestion. It is by igestion that the outward food becomes assimilated with the inner ife. Our souls are not nourished merely by listening awhile to this, nd then to that, and then to the other part of divine truth. Hearing, eading, marking, and learning, all require inwardly digesting to omplete their usefulness, and the inward digesting of the truth lies or the most part in meditating upon it. Why is it that some hristians, although they hear many sermons, make but slow advances in he divine life? Because they neglect their closets, and do not houghtfully meditate on God's Word. They love the wheat, but they do ot grind it; they would have the corn, but they will not go forth into he fields to gather it; the fruit hangs upon the tree, but they will ot pluck it; the water flows at their feet, but they will not stoop to rink it. From such folly deliver us, O Lord, and be this our resolve his morning, "I will meditate in thy precepts."</p>

<div class="response">
<p>This age is peculiarly the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, in which esus cheers us, not by his personal presence, as he shall do y-and-by, but by the indwelling and constant abiding of the Holy host, who is evermore the Comforter of the church. It is his office to onsole the hearts of God's people. He convinces of sin; he illuminates nd instructs; but still the main part of his work lies in making glad he hearts of the renewed, in confirming the weak, and lifting up all hose that be bowed down. He does this by revealing Jesus to them. The oly Spirit consoles, but Christ is the consolation. If we may use the igure, the Holy Spirit is the Physician, but Jesus is the medicine. He eals the wound, but it is by applying the holy ointment of Christ's ame and grace. He takes not of his own things, but of the things of hrist. So if we give to the Holy Spirit the Greek name of Paraclete, s we sometimes do, then our heart confers on our blessed Lord Jesus he title of Paraclesis. If the one be the Comforter, the other is the omfort. Now, with such rich provision for his need, why should the hristian be sad and desponding? The Holy Spirit has graciously engaged o be thy Comforter: dost thou imagine, O thou weak and trembling eliever, that he will be negligent of his sacred trust? Canst thou uppose that he has undertaken what he cannot or will not perform? If t be his especial work to strengthen thee, and to comfort thee, dost hou suppose he has forgotten his business, or that he will fail in the oving office which he sustains towards thee? Nay, think not so hardly f the tender and blessed Spirit whose name is "the Comforter." He elights to give the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise or the spirit of heaviness. Trust thou in him, and he will surely omfort thee till the house of mourning is closed forever, and the arriage feast has begun.</p>

<p>Godly sorrow worketh repentance.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">2 Corinthians</span> <span class="chapter">7</span>:<span class="verse">10</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>Genuine, spiritual mourning for sin is the work of the Spirit of God. epentance is too choice a flower to grow in nature's garden. Pearls row naturally in oysters, but penitence never shows itself in sinners xcept divine grace works it in them. If thou hast one particle of real atred for sin, God must have given it thee, for human nature's thorns ever produced a single fig. "That which is born of the flesh is lesh."</p>
<p>True repentance has a distinct reference to the Saviour. When we repent f sin, we must have one eye upon sin and another upon the cross, or it ill be better still if we fix both our eyes upon Christ and see our ransgressions only, in the light of his love.</p>
<p>True sorrow for sin is eminently practical. No man may say he hates in, if he lives in it. Repentance makes us see the evil of sin, not erely as a theory, but experimentally--as a burnt child dreads fire. e shall be as much afraid of it, as a man who has lately been stopped nd robbed is afraid of the thief upon the highway; and we shall shun t--shun it in everything--not in great things only, but in little hings, as men shun little vipers as well as great snakes. True ourning for sin will make us very jealous over our tongue, lest it hould say a wrong word; we shall be very watchful over our daily ctions, lest in anything we offend, and each night we shall close the ay with painful confessions of shortcoming, and each morning awaken ith anxious prayers, that this day God would hold us up that we may ot sin against him.</p>
<p>Sincere repentance is continual. Believers repent until their dying ay. This dropping well is not intermittent. Every other sorrow yields o time, but this dear sorrow grows with our growth, and it is so sweet  bitter, that we thank God we are permitted to enjoy and to suffer it ntil we enter our eternal rest.</p>

<p>Whose love can this be which is as mighty as the conqueror of monarchs, he destroyer of the human race? Would it not sound like satire if it ere applied to my poor, weak, and scarcely living love to Jesus my ord? I do love him, and perhaps by his grace, I could even die for im, but as for my love in itself, it can scarcely endure a scoffing est, much less a cruel death. Surely it is my Beloved's love which is ere spoken of--the love of Jesus, the matchless lover of souls. His ove was indeed stronger than the most terrible death, for it endured he trial of the cross triumphantly. It was a lingering death, but love urvived the torment; a shameful death, but love despised the shame; a enal death, but love bore our iniquities; a forsaken, lonely death, rom which the eternal Father hid his face, but love endured the curse, nd gloried over all. Never such love, never such death. It was a esperate duel, but love bore the palm. What then, my heart? Hast thou o emotions excited within thee at the contemplation of such heavenly ffection? Yes, my Lord, I long, I pant to feel thy love flaming like a urnace within me. Come thou thyself and excite the ardour of my pirit.</p>

<p>Why should I despair of loving Jesus with a love as strong as death? He eserves it: I desire it. The martyrs felt such love, and they were but lesh and blood, then why not I? They mourned their weakness, and yet ut of weakness were made strong. Grace gave them all their unflinching onstancy--there is the same grace for me. Jesus, lover of my soul, hed abroad such love, even thy love in my heart, this evening.</p>

<p>In these words the believer is invited to a holy nearness to Jesus.

It is being brought into the banqueting-house, where aves the banner of redeeming love. "Come and dine," gives us a vision f union with Jesus, because the only food that we can feast upon when e dine with Jesus is himself. Oh, what union is this! It is a depth hich reason cannot fathom, that we thus feed upon Jesus. "He that ateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him." It is also an invitation to enjoy fellowship with the saints. hristians may differ on a variety of points, but they have all one piritual appetite; and if we cannot all feel alike, we can all feed like on the bread of life sent down from heaven. At the table of ellowship with Jesus we are one bread and one cup. As the loving cup oes round we pledge one another heartily therein. Get nearer to Jesus, nd you will find yourself linked more and more in spirit to all who re like yourself, supported by the same heavenly manna. If we were ore near to Jesus we should be more near to one another. We likewise ee in these words the source of strength for every Christian. To look t Christ is to live, but for strength to serve him you must "come and ine." We labour under much unnecessary weakness on account of eglecting this precept of the Master.

Thus, hen, if you would realize nearness to Jesus, union with Jesus, love to is people and strength from Jesus, "come and dine" with him by faith.</p>

<p>With thee is the fountain of life.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>There are times in our spiritual experience when human counsel or ympathy, or religious ordinances, fail to comfort or help us. Why does ur gracious God permit this? Perhaps it is because we have been living oo much without him, and he therefore takes away everything upon which e have been in the habit of depending, that he may drive us to imself. It is a blessed thing to live at the fountain head. While our kin- bottles are full, we are content, like Hagar and Ishmael, to go nto the wilderness; but when those are dry, nothing will serve us but "Thou God seest me." We are like the prodigal, we love the wine-troughs and forget our Father's house. Remember, we can make wine-troughs and husks even out of the forms of religion; they are lessed things, but we may put them in God's place, and then they are f no value. Anything becomes an idol when it keeps us away from God: ven the brazen serpent is to be despised as "Nehushtan," if we worship t instead of God. The prodigal was never safer than when he was driven o his father's bosom, because he could find sustenance nowhere else. ur Lord favours us with a famine in the land that it may make us seek fter himself the more. The best position for a Christian is living holly and directly on God's grace--still abiding where he stood at irst--"Having nothing, and yet possessing all things." Let us never or a moment think that our standing is in our sanctification, our ortification, our graces, or our feelings, but know that because hrist offered a full atonement, therefore we are saved; for we are omplete in him. Having nothing of our own to trust to, but resting pon the merits of Jesus--his passion and holy life furnish us with the nly sure ground of confidence. Beloved, when we are brought to a hirsting condition, we are sure to turn to the fountain of life with agerness.</p>

<p>The thought of David's heart at this time was a false thought, because e certainly had no ground for thinking that God's anointing him by amuel was intended to be left as an empty unmeaning act. On no one ccasion had the Lord deserted his servant; he had been placed in erilous positions very often, but not one instance had occurred in hich divine interposition had not delivered him. The trials to which e had been exposed had been varied; they had not assumed one form nly, but many--yet in every case he who sent the trial had also raciously ordained a way of escape. David could not put his finger pon any entry in his diary, and say of it, "Here is evidence that the ord will forsake me," for the entire tenor of his past life proved the ery reverse. He should have argued from what God had done for him, hat God would be his defender still. But is it not just in the same ay that we doubt God's help? Is it not mistrust without a cause? Have e ever had the shadow of a reason to doubt our Father's goodness? Have ot his lovingkindnesses been marvellous? Has he once failed to justify ur trust? Ah, no! our God has not left us at any time. We have had ark nights, but the star of love has shone forth amid the blackness; e have been in stern conflicts, but over our head he has held aloft he shield of our defence. We have gone through many trials, but never o our detriment, always to our advantage; and the conclusion from our ast experience is, that he who has been with us in six troubles, will ot forsake us in the seventh. What we have known of our faithful God, roves that he will keep us to the end. Let us not, then, reason ontrary to evidence. How can we ever be so ungenerous as to doubt our od? Lord, throw down the Jezebel of our unbelief, and let the dogs evour it.</p>

<p>Our good Shepherd has in his flock a variety of experiences, some are trong in the Lord, and others are weak in faith, but he is impartial n his care for all his sheep, and the weakest lamb is as dear to him s the most advanced of the flock.

He finds ew-born souls, like young lambs, ready to perish--he nourishes them ill life becomes vigorous; he finds weak minds ready to faint and ie--he consoles them and renews their strength. All the little ones he athers, for it is not the will of our heavenly Father that one of them hould perish. What a quick eye he must have to see them all! What a ender heart to care for them all! What a far- reaching and potent arm, o gather them all! In his lifetime on earth he was a great gatherer of he weaker sort, and now that he dwells in heaven, his loving heart earns towards the meek and contrite, the timid and feeble, the fearful nd fainting here below. How gently did he gather me to himself, to his ruth, to his blood, to his love, to his church! With what effectual race did he compel me to come to himself!

<p>Many are "the paths of the Lord" which "drop fatness," but an especial ne is the path of prayer. No believer, who is much in the closet, will ave need to cry, "My leanness, my leanness; woe unto me." Starving ouls live at a distance from the mercy- seat, and become like the arched fields in times of drought. Prevalence with God in wrestling rayer is sure to make the believer strong--if not happy. The nearest lace to the gate of heaven is the throne of the heavenly grace. Much lone, and you will have much assurance; little alone with Jesus, your eligion will be shallow, polluted with many doubts and fears, and not parkling with the joy of the Lord. Since the soul-enriching path of rayer is open to the very weakest saint; since no high attainments are equired; since you are not bidden to come because you are an advanced aint, but freely invited if you be a saint at all; see to it, dear eader, that you are often in the way of private devotion. Be much on our knees, for so Elijah drew the rain upon famished Israel's fields.</p>
<p>There is another especial path dropping with fatness to those who walk herein, it is the secret walk of communion. Oh! the delights of ellowship with Jesus! Earth hath no words which can set forth the holy alm of a soul leaning on Jesus' bosom. Few Christians understand it, hey live in the lowlands and seldom climb to the top of Nebo: they ive in the outer court, they enter not the holy place, they take not p the privilege of priesthood. At a distance they see the sacrifice, ut they sit not down with the priest to eat thereof, and to enjoy the at of the burnt offering. But, reader, sit thou ever under the shadow f Jesus; come up to that palm tree, and take hold of the branches hereof; let thy beloved be unto thee as the apple-tree among the trees f the wood, and thou shalt be satisfied as with marrow and fatness. O esus, visit us with thy salvation!</p>

<p>Saul had been commanded to slay utterly all the Amalekites and their attle. Instead of doing so, he preserved the king, and suffered his eople to take the best of the oxen and of the sheep. When called to ccount for this, he declared that he did it with a view of offering acrifice to God; but Samuel met him at once with the assurance that acrifices were no excuse for an act of direct rebellion. The sentence efore us is worthy to be printed in letters of gold, and to be hung up efore the eyes of the present idolatrous generation, who are very fond f the fineries of will-worship, but utterly neglect the laws of God. e it ever in your remembrance, that to keep strictly in the path of our Saviour's command is better than any outward form of religion; and o hearken to his precept with an attentive ear is better than to bring he fat of rams, or any other precious thing to lay upon his altar. If ou are failing to keep the least of Christ's commands to his isciples, I pray you be disobedient no longer. All the pretensions you ake of attachment to your Master, and all the devout actions which you ay perform, are no recompense for disobedience. "To obey," even in the lightest and smallest thing, "is better than sacrifice," however ompous. Talk not of Gregorian chants, sumptuous robes, incense, and anners; the first thing which God requires of his child is obedience; nd though you should give your body to be burned, and all your goods o feed the poor, yet if you do not hearken to the Lord's precepts, all our formalities shall profit you nothing. It is a blessed thing to be eachable as a little child, but it is a much more blessed thing when ne has been taught the lesson, to carry it out to the letter. How many dorn their temples and decorate their priests, but refuse to obey the ord of the Lord! My soul, come not thou into their secret.</p>

It is easy to sing when we can read the notes by daylight; ut he is skilful who sings when there is not a ray of light to read y--who sings from his heart. No man can make a song in the night of imself; he may attempt it, but he will find that a song in the night ust be divinely inspired. Let all things go well, I can weave songs, ashioning them wherever I go out of the flowers that grow upon my ath; but put me in a desert, where no green thing grows, and wherewith hall I frame a hymn of praise to God? How shall a mortal man make a rown for the Lord where no jewels are? Let but this voice be clear, nd this body full of health, and I can sing God's praise: silence my ongue, lay me upon the bed of languishing, and how shall I then chant od's high praises, unless he himself give me the song? No, it is not n man's power to sing when all is adverse, unless an altar-coal shall ouch his lip. It was a divine song, which Habakkuk sang, when in the ight he said, "Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall ruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the ields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, nd there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the ord, I will joy in the God of my salvation." Then, since our Maker ives songs in the night, let us wait upon him for the music. O thou hief musician, let us not remain songless because affliction is upon s, but tune thou our lips to the melody of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Many Christians remain stunted and dwarfed in spiritual things, so as o present the same appearance year after year. No up-springing of dvanced and refined feeling is manifest in them. They exist but do not "grow up into him in all things." But should we rest content with being n the "green blade," when we might advance to "the ear," and ventually ripen into the "full corn in the ear?" Should we be atisfied to believe in Christ, and to say, "I am safe," without ishing to know in our own experience more of the fulness which is to e found in him. It should not be so; we should, as good traders in eaven's market, covet to be enriched in the knowledge of Jesus. It is ll very well to keep other men's vineyards, but we must not neglect ur own spiritual growth and ripening. Why should it always be winter ime in our hearts? We must have our seed time, it is true, but O for a pring time--yea, a summer season, which shall give promise of an early arvest. If we would ripen in grace, we must live near to Jesus--in his resence--ripened by the sunshine of his smiles. We must hold sweet ommunion with him. We must leave the distant view of his face and come ear, as John did, and pillow our head on his breast; then shall we ind ourselves advancing in holiness, in love, in faith, in hope--yea, n every precious gift. As the sun rises first on mountain-tops and ilds them with his light, and presents one of the most charming sights o the eye of the traveller; so is it one of the most delightful ontemplations in the world to mark the glow of the Spirit's light on he head of some saint, who has risen up in spiritual stature, like aul, above his fellows, till, like a mighty Alp, snow-capped, he eflects first among the chosen, the beams of the Sun of Righteousness, nd bears the sheen of his effulgence high aloft for all to see, and eeing it, to glorify his Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>This sentence is a body of divinity in miniature. He who understands ts meaning is a theologian, and he who can dive into its fulness is a rue master in Israel. It is a condensation of the glorious message of alvation which was delivered to us in Christ Jesus our Redeemer. The ense hinges upon the word "freely." This is the glorious, the uitable, the divine way by which love streams from heaven to earth, a pontaneous love flowing forth to those who neither deserved it, urchased it, nor sought after it. It is, indeed, the only way in which od can love such as we are. The text is a death-blow to all sorts of itness: "I will love them freely." Now, if there were any fitness ecessary in us, then he would not love us freely; at least, this would e a mitigation and a drawback to the freeness of it. But it stands, "I ill love you freely." We complain, "Lord, my heart is so hard." "I ill love you freely." "But I do not feel my need of Christ as I could ish." "I will not love you because you feel your need; I will love you reely." "But I do not feel that softening of spirit which I could esire." Remember, the softening of spirit is not a condition, for here are no conditions; the covenant of grace has no conditionality hatever; so that we without any fitness may venture upon the promise f God which was made to us in Christ Jesus, when he said, "He that elieveth on him is not condemned." It is blessed to know that the race of God is free to us at all times, without preparation, without itness, without money, and without price! "I will love them freely." These words invite backsliders to return: indeed, the text was pecially written for such--"I will heal their backsliding; I will love hem freely." Backslider! surely the generosity of the promise will at nce break your heart, and you will return, and seek your injured ather's face.</p>

Think not hat Christ hath placed his joys on heavenly shelves that we may climb p to them for ourselves, but he draws near, and sheds his peace abroad n our hearts. O Christian, if thou art tonight labouring under deep istresses, thy Father does not give thee promises and then leave thee o draw them up from the Word like buckets from a well, but the romises he has written in the Word he will write anew on your heart. e will manifest his love to you, and by his blessed Spirit, dispel our cares and troubles.

When we re hard beset with this world, or with the severer trials within the hurch, we find it a most blessed thing to pillow our head upon the osom of our Saviour. This is the joy we have today that we are saved n him; and if this joy be satisfying, wherefore should we think of hanging? Who barters gold for dross? We will not forswear the sun till e find a better light, nor leave our Lord until a brighter lover shall ppear; and, since this can never be, we will hold him with a grasp mmortal, and bind his name as a seal upon our arm. As for the future, an you suggest anything which can arise that shall render it necessary or you to mutiny, or desert the old flag to serve under another aptain? We think not. If life be long--he changes not. If we are poor, hat better than to have Christ who can make us rich? When we are sick, hat more do we want than Jesus to make our bed in our sickness? When e die, is it not written that "neither death, nor life, nor things resent, nor things to come, shall be able to separate us from the love f God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord!" We say with Peter, "Lord, o whom shall we go?"</p>

<p>Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p>

<p>When is the Christian most liable to sleep? Is it not when his temporal ircumstances are prosperous? Have you not found it so? When you had aily troubles to take to the throne of grace, were you not more akeful than you are now? Easy roads make sleepy travellers. Another angerous time is when all goes pleasantly in spiritual matters. hristian went not to sleep when lions were in the way, or when he was ading through the river, or when fighting with Apollyon, but when he ad climbed half way up the Hill Difficulty, and came to a delightful rbour, he sat down, and forthwith fell asleep, to his great sorrow and oss. The enchanted ground is a place of balmy breezes, laden with ragrant odours and soft influences, all tending to lull pilgrims to leep. Remember Bunyan's description: "Then they came to an arbour, arm, and promising much refreshing to the weary pilgrims; for it was inely wrought above head, beautified with greens, and furnished with enches and settles. It had also in it a soft couch, where the weary ight lean." "The arbour was called the Slothful's Friend, and was made n purpose to allure, if it might be, some of the pilgrims to take up heir rest there when weary." Depend upon it, it is in easy places that en shut their eyes and wander into the dreamy land of forgetfulness. ld Erskine wisely remarked, "I like a roaring devil better than a leeping devil." There is no temptation half so dangerous as not being empted. The distressed soul does not sleep; it is after we enter into eaceful confidence and full assurance that we are in danger of lumbering. The disciples fell asleep after they had seen Jesus ransfigured on the mountain top. Take heed, joyous Christian, good rames are near neighbours to temptations: be as happy as you will, nly be watchful.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Without sap the tree cannot flourish or even exist. Vitality is ssential to a Christian. There must be life--a vital principle infused nto us by God the Holy Ghost, or we cannot be trees of the Lord. The ere name of being a Christian is but a dead thing, we must be filled ith the spirit of divine life. This life is mysterious. We do not nderstand the circulation of the sap, by what force it rises, and by hat power it descends again. So the life within us is a sacred ystery. Regeneration is wrought by the Holy Ghost entering into man nd becoming man's life; and this divine life in a believer afterwards eeds upon the flesh and blood of Christ and is thus sustained by ivine food, but whence it cometh and whither it goeth who shall xplain to us? What a secret thing the sap is! The roots go searching hrough the soil with their little spongioles, but we cannot see them uck out the various gases, or transmute the mineral into the egetable; this work is done down in the dark. Our root is Christ esus, and our life is hid in him; this is the secret of the Lord. The adix of the Christian life is as secret as the life itself. How ermanently active is the sap in the cedar! In the Christian the divine ife is always full of energy--not always in fruit-bearing, but in nward operations. The believer's graces are not every one of them in onstant motion, but his life never ceases to palpitate within. He is ot always working for God, but his heart is always living upon him. As he sap manifests itself in producing the foliage and fruit of the ree, so with a truly healthy Christian, his grace is externally anifested in his walk and conversation. If you talk with him, he annot help speaking about Jesus. If you notice his actions you will ee that he has been with Jesus. He has so much sap within, that it ust fill his conduct and conversation with life.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>The Lord Jesus loves his people so much, that every day he is still oing for them much that is analogous to washing their soiled feet. heir poorest actions he accepts; their deepest sorrow he feels; their lenderest wish he hears, and their every transgression he forgives. He s still their servant as well as their Friend and Master. He not only erforms majestic deeds for them, as wearing the mitre on his brow, and he precious jewels glittering on his breastplate, and standing up to lead for them, but humbly, patiently, he yet goes about among his eople with the basin and the towel. He does this when he puts away rom us day by day our constant infirmities and sins. Last night, when ou bowed the knee, you mournfully confessed that much of your conduct as not worthy of your profession; and even tonight, you must mourn fresh that you have fallen again into the selfsame folly and sin from hich special grace delivered you long ago; and yet Jesus will have reat patience with you; he will hear your confession of sin; he will ay, "I will, be thou clean"; he will again apply the blood of prinkling, and speak peace to your conscience, and remove every spot. t is a great act of eternal love when Christ once for all absolves the inner, and puts him into the family of God; but what condescending atience there is when the Saviour with much long-suffering bears the ft recurring follies of his wayward disciple; day by day, and hour by our, washing away the multiplied transgressions of his erring but yet eloved child! To dry up a flood of rebellion is something marvellous, ut to endure the constant dropping of repeated offences--to bear with  perpetual trying of patience, this is divine indeed! While we find omfort and peace in our Lord's daily cleansing, its legitimate nfluence upon us will be to increase our watchfulness, and quicken our esire for holiness. Is it so?</p>

<p>Once let the truth of God obtain an entrance into the human heart and ubdue the whole man unto itself, no power human or infernal can islodge it. We entertain it not as a guest but as the master of the ouse--this is a Christian necessity, he is no Christian who doth not hus believe. Those who feel the vital power of the gospel, and know he might of the Holy Ghost as he opens, applies, and seals the Lord's ord, would sooner be torn to pieces than be rent away from the gospel f their salvation. What a thousand mercies are wrapped up in the ssurance that the truth will be with us forever; will be our living upport, our dying comfort, our rising song, our eternal glory; this is hristian privilege, without it our faith were little worth. Some ruths we outgrow and leave behind, for they are but rudiments and essons for beginners, but we cannot thus deal with Divine truth, for hough it is sweet food for babes, it is in the highest sense strong eat for men. The truth that we are sinners is painfully with us to umble and make us watchful; the more blessed truth that whosoever elieveth on the Lord Jesus shall be saved, abides with us as our hope nd joy. Experience, so far from loosening our hold of the doctrines of race, has knit us to them more and more firmly; our grounds and otives for believing are now more strong, more numerous than ever, and e have reason to expect that it will be so till in death we clasp the aviour in our arms.</p>
<p>Wherever this abiding love of truth can be discovered, we are bound to xercise our love. No narrow circle can contain our gracious ympathies, wide as the election of grace must be our communion of eart. Much of error may be mingled with truth received, let us war ith the error but still love the brother for the measure of truth hich we see in him; above all let us love and spread the truth urselves.</p>

<p>Churlish souls stint their contributions to the ministry and missionary perations, and call such saving good economy; little do they dream hat they are thus impoverishing themselves. Their excuse is that they ust care for their own families, and they forget that to neglect the ouse of God is the sure way to bring ruin upon their own houses. Our od has a method in providence by which he can succeed our endeavours eyond our expectation, or can defeat our plans to our confusion and ismay; by a turn of his hand he can steer our vessel in a profitable hannel, or run it aground in poverty and bankruptcy. It is the eaching of Scripture that the Lord enriches the liberal and leaves the iserly to find out that withholding tendeth to poverty. In a very wide phere of observation, I have noticed that the most generous Christians f my acquaintance have been always the most happy, and almost nvariably the most prosperous. I have seen the liberal giver rise to ealth of which he never dreamed; and I have as often seen the mean, ngenerous churl descend to poverty by the very parsimony by which he hought to rise. Men trust good stewards with larger and larger sums, nd so it frequently is with the Lord; he gives by cartloads to those ho give by bushels. Where wealth is not bestowed the Lord makes the ittle much by the contentment which the sanctified heart feels in a ortion of which the tithe has been dedicated to the Lord. Selfishness ooks first at home, but godliness seeks first the kingdom of God and is righteousness, yet in the long run selfishness is loss, and odliness is great gain. It needs faith to act towards our God with an pen hand, but surely he deserves it of us; and all that we can do is a ery poor acknowledgment of our amazing indebtedness to his goodness.</p>

<p>It is a faithful saying.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">2 Timothy</span> <span class="chapter">2</span>:<span class="verse">11</span></cite>

<div class="response">
<p>Paul has four of these "faithful sayings." The first occurs in 1 imothy 1:15, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all cceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." The next is in 1 Timothy 4:6, "Godliness is profitable unto all things, aving the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to ome. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation." The hird is in 2 Timothy 2:12, "It is a faithful saying--If we suffer with im we shall also reign with him"; and the fourth is in Titus 3:3, "This is a faithful saying, that they which have believed in God might e careful to maintain good works." We may trace a connection between hese faithful sayings. The first one lays the foundation of our ternal salvation in the free grace of God, as shown to us in the ission of the great Redeemer. The next affirms the double blessedness hich we obtain through this salvation--the blessings of the upper and ether springs--of time and of eternity. The third shows one of the uties to which the chosen people are called; we are ordained to suffer or Christ with the promise that "if we suffer, we shall also reign ith him." The last sets forth the active form of Christian service, idding us diligently to maintain good works. Thus we have the root of alvation in free grace; next, the privileges of that salvation in the ife which now is, and in that which is to come; and we have also the wo great branches of suffering with Christ and serving with Christ, oaded with the fruits of the Spirit. Treasure up these faithful ayings. Let them be the guides of our life, our comfort, and our nstruction. The apostle of the Gentiles proved them to be faithful, hey are faithful still, not one word shall fall to the ground; they re worthy of all acceptation, let us accept them now, and prove their aithfulness. Let these four faithful sayings be written on the four orners of my house.</p>

<p>The believer is a new creature, he belongs to a holy generation and a eculiar people--the Spirit of God is in him, and in all respects he is ar removed from the natural man; but for all that the Christian is a inner still. He is so from the imperfection of his nature, and will ontinue so to the end of his earthly life. The black fingers of sin eave smuts upon our fairest robes. Sin mars our repentance, ere the reat Potter has finished it, upon the wheel. Selfishness defiles our ears, and unbelief tampers with our faith. The best thing we ever did part from the merit of Jesus only swelled the number of our sins; for hen we have been most pure in our own sight, yet, like the heavens, we re not pure in God's sight; and as he charged his angels with folly, uch more must he charge us with it, even in our most angelic frames of ind. The song which thrills to heaven, and seeks to emulate seraphic trains, hath human discords in it. The prayer which moves the arm of od is still a bruised and battered prayer, and only moves that arm ecause the sinless One, the great Mediator, has stepped in to take way the sin of our supplication. The most golden faith or the purest egree of sanctification to which a Christian ever attained on earth, as still so much alloy in it as to be only worthy of the flames, in tself considered. Every night we look in the glass we see a sinner, nd had need confess, "We are all as an unclean thing, and all our ighteousnesses are as filthy rags." Oh, how precious the blood of hrist to such hearts as ours! How priceless a gift is his perfect ighteousness! And how bright the hope of perfect holiness hereafter! ven now, though sin dwells in us, its power is broken. It has no ominion; it is a broken-backed snake; we are in bitter conflict with t, but it is with a vanquished foe that we have to deal.

<p>This prayer begins where all true prayer must commence, with the spirit f adoption, "Our Father." There is no acceptable prayer until we can ay, "I will arise, and go unto my Father." This child-like spirit soon erceives the grandeur of the Father "in heaven," and ascends to devout doration, "Hallowed be thy name." The child lisping, "Abba, Father," grows into the cherub crying, "Holy, Holy, Holy." There is but a step rom rapturous worship to the glowing missionary spirit, which is a ure outgrowth of filial love and reverent adoration--"Thy kingdom ome, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Next follows the eartfelt expression of dependence upon God--"Give us this day our aily bread." Being further illuminated by the Spirit, he discovers hat he is not only dependent, but sinful, hence he entreats for mercy, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors:" and being pardoned, aving the righteousness of Christ imputed, and knowing his acceptance ith God, he humbly supplicates for holy perseverance, "Lead us not nto temptation." The man who is really forgiven, is anxious not to ffend again; the possession of justification leads to an anxious esire for sanctification. "Forgive us our debts," that is ustification; "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil," that is sanctification in its negative and positive forms. As the esult of all this, there follows a triumphant ascription of praise,</p>
<p>"Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, men." We rejoice that our King reigns in providence and shall reign in race, from the river even to the ends of the earth, and of his ominion there shall be no end. Thus from a sense of adoption, up to ellowship with our reigning Lord, this short model of prayer conducts he soul. Lord, teach us thus to pray.</p>

Let the ripe ruit drop upon the fertile soil from which it drew its life. Deny not  song to him who hath answered thy prayer and given thee the desire of hy heart. To be silent over God's mercies is to incur the guilt of ngratitude; it is to act as basely as the nine lepers, who after they ad been cured of their leprosy, returned not to give thanks unto the ealing Lord. To forget to praise God is to refuse to benefit urselves; for praise, like prayer, is one great means of promoting the rowth of the spiritual life. It helps to remove our burdens, to excite ur hope, to increase our faith. It is a healthful and invigorating xercise which quickens the pulse of the believer, and nerves him for resh enterprises in his Master's service. To bless God for mercies eceived is also the way to benefit our fellow-men; "the humble shall ear thereof and be glad." Others who have been in like circumstances hall take comfort if we can say, "Oh! magnify the Lord with me, and et us exalt his name together; this poor man cried, and the Lord heard im." Weak hearts will be strengthened, and drooping saints will be evived as they listen to our "songs of deliverance." Their doubts and ears will be rebuked, as we teach and admonish one another in psalms nd hymns and spiritual songs. They too shall "sing in the ways of the ord," when they hear us magnify his holy name. Praise is the most eavenly of Christian duties. The angels pray not, but they cease not o praise both day and night; and the redeemed, clothed in white robes, ith palm-branches in their hands, are never weary of singing the new ong, "Worthy is the Lamb."</p>

<p>My sweet Lord Jesus remembers well the garden of Gethsemane, and lthough he has left that garden, he now dwells in the garden of his hurch: there he unbosoms himself to those who keep his blessed ompany.

Ten of thousands on arth, and millions above, are indulged with its harmonious accents. ome whom I well know, and whom I greatly envy, are at this moment earkening to the beloved voice. O that I were a partaker of their oys! It is true some of these are poor, others bedridden, and some ear the gates of death, but O my Lord, I would cheerfully starve with hem, pine with them, or die with them, if I might but hear thy voice. nce I did hear it often, but I have grieved thy Spirit. Return unto me n compassion, and once again say unto me, "I am thy salvation." No ther voice can content me; I know thy voice, and cannot be deceived by nother, let me hear it, I pray thee. I know not what thou wilt say, either do I make any condition, O my Beloved, do but let me hear thee peak, and if it be a rebuke I will bless thee for it. Perhaps to leanse my dull ear may need an operation very grievous to the flesh, ut let it cost what it may I turn not from the one consuming desire, ause me to hear thy voice. Bore my ear afresh; pierce my ear with thy arshest notes, only do not permit me to continue deaf to thy calls. onight, Lord, grant thine unworthy one his desire, for I am thine, and hou hast bought me with thy blood. Thou hast opened mine eye to see hee, and the sight has saved me. Lord, open thou mine ear. I have read hy heart, now let me hear thy lips.</p>

<p>A backslider, if there be a spark of life left in him will groan after estoration. In this renewal the same exercise of grace is required as t our conversion. We needed repentance then; we certainly need it now. e wanted faith that we might come to Christ at first; only the like race can bring us to Jesus now. We wanted a word from the Most High, a ord from the lip of the loving One, to end our fears then; we shall oon discover, when under a sense of present sin, that we need it now. o man can be renewed without as real and true a manifestation of the oly Spirit's energy as he felt at first, because the work is as great, nd flesh and blood are as much in the way now as ever they were. Let hy personal weakness, O Christian, be an argument to make thee pray arnestly to thy God for help. Remember, David when he felt himself to e powerless, did not fold his arms or close his lips, but he hastened o the mercy-seat with "renew a right spirit within me." Let not the octrine that you, unaided, can do nothing, make you sleep; but let it e a goad in your side to drive you with an awful earnestness to srael's strong Helper. O that you may have grace to plead with God, as hough you pleaded for your very life--"Lord, renew a right spirit ithin me." He who sincerely prays to God to do this, will prove his onesty by using the means through which God works. Be much in prayer; ive much upon the Word of God; kill the lusts which have driven your ord from you; be careful to watch over the future uprisings of sin. he Lord has his own appointed ways; sit by the wayside and you will be eady when he passes by. Continue in all those blessed ordinances which ill foster and nourish your dying graces; and, knowing that all the ower must proceed from him, cease not to cry, "Renew a right spirit ithin me."</p>

<p>It is well for us that, amidst all the variableness of life, there is ne whom change cannot affect; One whose heart can never alter, and on hose brow mutability can make no furrows. All things else have hanged--all things are changing. The sun itself grows dim with age; he world is waxing old; the folding up of the worn-out vesture has ommenced; the heavens and earth must soon pass away; they shall erish, they shall wax old as doth a garment; but there is One who only ath immortality, of whose years there is no end, and in whose person here is no change. The delight which the mariner feels, when, after aving been tossed about for many a day, he steps again upon the solid hore, is the satisfaction of a Christian when, amidst all the changes f this troublous life, he rests the foot of his faith upon this ruth--"I am the Lord, I change not."</p>
<p>The stability which the anchor gives the ship when it has at last btained a hold-fast, is like that which the Christian's hope affords im when it fixes itself upon this glorious truth. With God "is no ariableness, neither shadow of turning." Whatever his attributes were f old, they are now; his power, his wisdom, his justice, his truth, re alike unchanged. He has ever been the refuge of his people, their tronghold in the day of trouble, and he is their sure Helper still. He s unchanged in his love. He has loved his people with "an everlasting ove"; he loves them now as much as ever he did, and when all earthly hings shall have melted in the last conflagration, his love will still ear the dew of its youth. Precious is the assurance that he changes ot! The wheel of providence revolves, but its axle is eternal love.</p>
<p>"Death and change are busy ever,</p>

<p>My soul, feelest thou this holy shuddering at the sins of others? for therwise thou lackest inward holiness. David's cheeks were wet with ivers of waters because of prevailing unholiness, Jeremiah desired yes like fountains that he might lament the iniquities of Israel, and ot was vexed with the conversation of the men of Sodom. Those upon hom the mark was set in Ezekiel's vision, were those who sighed and ried for the abominations of Jerusalem. It cannot but grieve gracious ouls to see what pains men take to go to hell. They know the evil of in experimentally, and they are alarmed to see others flying like oths into its blaze. Sin makes the righteous shudder, because it iolates a holy law, which it is to every man's highest interest to eep; it pulls down the pillars of the commonwealth. Sin in others orrifies a believer, because it puts him in mind of the baseness of is own heart: when he sees a transgressor he cries with the saint entioned by Bernard, "He fell today, and I may fall to-morrow." Sin to  believer is horrible, because it crucified the Saviour; he sees in very iniquity the nails and spear. How can a saved soul behold that ursed kill-Christ sin without abhorrence? Say, my heart, dost thou ensibly join in all this? It is an awful thing to insult God to His ace. The good God deserves better treatment, the great God claims it, he just God will have it, or repay His adversary to his face. An wakened heart trembles at the audacity of sin, and stands alarmed at he contemplation of its punishment. How monstrous a thing is ebellion! How direful a doom is prepared for the ungodly! My soul, ever laugh at sin's fooleries, lest thou come to smile at sin itself. t is thine enemy, and thy Lord's enemy.

<p>Prayers are instantly noticed in heaven. The moment Saul began to pray he Lord heard him. Here is comfort for the distressed but praying oul. Oftentimes a poor broken-hearted one bends his knee, but can only tter his wailing in the language of sighs and tears; yet that groan as made all the harps of heaven thrill with music; that tear has been aught by God and treasured in the lachrymatory of heaven. "Thou uttest my tears into thy bottle," implies that they are caught as they low. The suppliant, whose fears prevent his words, will be well nderstood by the Most High. He may only look up with misty eye; but "prayer is the falling of a tear." Tears are the diamonds of heaven; ighs are a part of the music of Jehovah's court, and are numbered with
<p>"the sublimest strains that reach the majesty on high." Think not that our prayer, however weak or trembling, will be unregarded. Jacob's adder is lofty, but our prayers shall lean upon the Angel of the ovenant and so climb its starry rounds. Our God not only hears prayer ut also loves to hear it. "He forgetteth not the cry of the humble."</p></p>
<p>True, He regards not high looks and lofty words; He cares not for the omp and pageantry of kings; He listens not to the swell of martial usic; He regards not the triumph and pride of man; but wherever there s a heart big with sorrow, or a lip quivering with agony, or a deep roan, or a penitential sigh, the heart of Jehovah is open; He marks it own in the registry of His memory; He puts our prayers, like rose eaves, between the pages of His book of remembrance, and when the olume is opened at last, there shall be a precious fragrance springing p therefrom.</p>
<p>"Faith asks no signal from the skies,</p>
<p>To show that prayers accepted rise,</p>

<p>Prayer is the never-failing resort of the Christian in any case, in very plight. When you cannot use your sword you may take to the weapon f all-prayer. Your powder may be damp, your bow-string may be relaxed, ut the weapon of all-prayer need never be out of order. Leviathan aughs at the javelin, but he trembles at prayer. Sword and spear need urbishing, but prayer never rusts, and when we think it most blunt it uts the best. Prayer is an open door which none can shut. Devils may urround you on all sides, but the way upward is always open, and as ong as that road is unobstructed, you will not fall into the enemy's and. We can never be taken by blockade, escalade, mine, or storm, so ong as heavenly succours can come down to us by Jacob's ladder to elieve us in the time of our necessities. Prayer is never out of eason: in summer and in winter its merchandise is precious. Prayer ains audience with heaven in the dead of night, in the midst of usiness, in the heat of noonday, in the shades of evening. In every ondition, whether of poverty, or sickness, or obscurity, or slander, r doubt, your covenant God will welcome your prayer and answer it from is holy place. Nor is prayer ever futile. True prayer is evermore true ower. You may not always get what you ask, but you shall always have our real wants supplied. When God does not answer His children ccording to the letter, He does so according to the spirit. If thou skest for coarse meal, wilt thou be angered because He gives thee the inest flour? If thou seekest bodily health, shouldst thou complain if nstead thereof He makes thy sickness turn to the healing of spiritual aladies? Is it not better to have the cross sanctified than removed? his evening, my soul, forget not to offer thy petition and request, or the Lord is ready to grant thee thy desires.</p>

God will not go forth with that man who marches in his own trength.

They who go forth to fight, boasting of their prowess, shall eturn with their gay banners trailed in the dust, and their armour tained with disgrace. Those who serve God must serve him in his own ay, and in his strength, or he will never accept their service. That hich man doth, unaided by divine strength, God can never own. The mere ruits of the earth he casteth away; he will only reap that corn, the eed of which was sown from heaven, watered by grace, and ripened by he sun of divine love.

<p>When a believer has fallen into a low, sad state of feeling, he often ries to lift himself out of it by chastening himself with dark and oleful fears. Such is not the way to rise from the dust, but to ontinue in it. As well chain the eagle's wing to make it mount, as oubt in order to increase our grace. It is not the law, but the gospel hich saves the seeking soul at first; and it is not a legal bondage, ut gospel liberty which can restore the fainting believer afterwards. lavish fear brings not back the backslider to God, but the sweet ooings of love allure him to Jesus' bosom. Are you this morning hirsting for the living God, and unhappy because you cannot find him o the delight of your heart? Have you lost the joy of religion, and is his your prayer, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation"? Are you onscious also that you are barren, like the dry ground; that you are ot bringing forth the fruit unto God which he has a right to expect of ou; that you are not so useful in the Church, or in the world, as your eart desires to be? Then here is exactly the promise which you need, "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty." You shall receive the race you so much require, and you shall have it to the utmost reach of our needs. Water refreshes the thirsty: you shall be refreshed; your esires shall be gratified. Water quickens sleeping vegetable life: our life shall be quickened by fresh grace. Water swells the buds and akes the fruits ripen; you shall have fructifying grace: you shall be ade fruitful in the ways of God. Whatever good quality there is in ivine grace, you shall enjoy it to the full. All the riches of divine race you shall receive in plenty; you shall be as it were drenched ith it: and as sometimes the meadows become flooded by the bursting ivers, and the fields are turned into pools, so shall you be--the hirsty land shall be springs of water.</p>

<p>Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined nto you.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>There is a strange power about the very name of blood, and the sight of t is always affecting. A kind heart cannot bear to see a sparrow leed, and unless familiarized by use, turns away with horror at the laughter of a beast. As to the blood of men, it is a consecrated hing: it is murder to shed it in wrath, it is a dreadful crime to quander it in war. Is this solemnity occasioned by the fact that the lood is the life, and the pouring of it forth the token of death? We hink so. When we rise to contemplate the blood of the Son of God, our we is yet more increased, and we shudder as we think of the guilt of in, and the terrible penalty which the Sin-bearer endured. Blood, lways precious, is priceless when it streams from Immanuel's side. The lood of Jesus seals the covenant of grace, and makes it forever sure. ovenants of old were made by sacrifice, and the everlasting covenant as ratified in the same manner. Oh, the delight of being saved upon he sure foundation of divine engagements which cannot be dishonoured! alvation by the works of the law is a frail and broken vessel whose hipwreck is sure; but the covenant vessel fears no storms, for the lood ensures the whole. The blood of Jesus made his testament valid. ills are of no power unless the testators die. In this light the oldier's spear is a blessed aid to faith, since it proved our Lord to e really dead. Doubts upon that matter there can be none, and we may oldly appropriate the legacies which he has left for his people. Happy hey who see their title to heavenly blessings assured to them by a ying Saviour. But has this blood no voice to us? Does it not bid us anctify ourselves unto him by whom we have been redeemed? Does it not all us to newness of life, and incite us to entire consecration to the ord? O that the power of the blood might be known, and felt in us this ight!</p>

<p>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.</p>
<cite class="bibleref"><span class="book">Isaiah</span> <span class="chapter">49</span>:<span class="verse">16</span></cite>
</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>No doubt a part of the wonder which is concentrated in the word "Behold," is excited by the unbelieving lamentation of the preceding entence. Zion said, "The Lord hath forsaken me, and my God hath orgotten me." How amazed the divine mind seems to be at this wicked nbelief! What can be more astounding than the unfounded doubts and ears of God's favoured people? The Lord's loving word of rebuke should ake us blush; he cries, "How can I have forgotten thee, when I have raven thee upon the palms of my hands? How darest thou doubt my onstant remembrance, when the memorial is set upon my very flesh?" O nbelief, how strange a marvel thou art! We know not which most to onder at, the faithfulness of God or the unbelief of his people. He eeps his promise a thousand times, and yet the next trial makes us oubt him. He never faileth; he is never a dry well; he is never as a etting sun, a passing meteor, or a melting vapour; and yet we are as ontinually vexed with anxieties, molested with suspicions, and isturbed with fears, as if our God were the mirage of the desert.</p>
<p>"Behold," is a word intended to excite admiration. Here, indeed, we ave a theme for marvelling. Heaven and earth may well be astonished hat rebels should obtain so great a nearness to the heart of infinite ove as to be written upon the palms of his hands. "I have graven hee." It does not say, "Thy name." The name is there, but that is not ll: "I have graven thee." See the fulness of this! I have graven thy erson, thine image, thy case, thy circumstances, thy sins, thy emptations, thy weaknesses, thy wants, thy works; I have graven thee, verything about thee, all that concerns thee; I have put thee ltogether there. Wilt thou ever say again that thy God hath forsaken hee when he has graven thee upon his own palms?</p>

<p>In order to learn how to discharge your duty as a witness for Christ, ook at his example. He is always witnessing: by the well of Samaria, r in the Temple of Jerusalem: by the lake of Gennesaret, or on the ountain's brow. He is witnessing night and day; his mighty prayers are s vocal to God as his daily services. He witnesses under all ircumstances; Scribes and Pharisees cannot shut his mouth; even before ilate he witnesses a good confession. He witnesses so clearly, and istinctly that there is no mistake in him. Christian, make your life a lear testimony. Be you as the brook wherein you may see every stone at he bottom--not as the muddy creek, of which you only see the urface--but clear and transparent, so that your heart's love to God nd man may be visible to all. You need not say, "I am true:" be true. oast not of integrity, but be upright. So shall your testimony be such hat men cannot help seeing it. Never, for fear of feeble man, restrain our witness. Your lips have been warmed with a coal from off the ltar; let them speak as like heaven-touched lips should do. "In the orning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand." Watch not the clouds, consult not the wind--in season and out of season itness for the Saviour, and if it shall come to pass that for Christ's ake and the gospel's you shall endure suffering in any shape, shrink ot, but rejoice in the honour thus conferred upon you, that you are ounted worthy to suffer with your Lord; and joy also in this--that our sufferings, your losses, and persecutions shall make you a latform, from which the more vigorously and with greater power you hall witness for Christ Jesus. Study your great Exemplar, and be illed with his Spirit. Remember that you need much teaching, much pholding, much grace, and much humility, if your witnessing is to be o your Master's glory.</p>

<p>The life of faith is represented as receiving--an act which implies the ery opposite of anything like merit. It is simply the acceptance of a ift. As the earth drinks in the rain, as the sea receives the streams, s night accepts light from the stars, so we, giving nothing, partake reely of the grace of God. The saints are not, by nature, wells, or treams, they are but cisterns into which the living water flows; they re empty vessels into which God pours his salvation. The idea of eceiving implies a sense of realization, making the matter a reality. ne cannot very well receive a shadow; we receive that which is ubstantial: so is it in the life of faith, Christ becomes real to us. hile we are without faith, Jesus is a mere name to us--a person who ived a long while ago, so long ago that his life is only a history to s now! By an act of faith Jesus becomes a real person in the onsciousness of our heart. But receiving also means grasping or etting possession of. The thing which I receive becomes my own: I ppropriate to myself that which is given. When I receive Jesus, he ecomes my Saviour, so mine that neither life nor death shall be able o rob me of him. All this is to receive Christ--to take him as God's ree gift; to realize him in my heart, and to appropriate him as mine.</p>
<p>Salvation may be described as the blind receiving sight, the deaf eceiving hearing, the dead receiving life; but we have not only eceived these blessings, we have received Christ Jesus himself. It is rue that he gave us life from the dead. He gave us pardon of sin; he ave us imputed righteousness. These are all precious things, but we re not content with them; we have received Christ himself. The Son of od has been poured into us, and we have received him, and appropriated im. What a heartful Jesus must be, for heaven itself cannot contain im!</p>

It was through the mysterious power exerted by our Lord that he householder raised no question, but at once cheerfully and joyfully pened his guestchamber. Who he was, and what he was, we do not know, ut he readily accepted the honour which the Redeemer proposed to onfer upon him. In like manner it is still discovered who are the ord's chosen, and who are not; for when the gospel comes to some, they ight against it, and will not have it, but where men receive it, elcoming it, this is a sure indication that there is a secret work oing on in the soul, and that God has chosen them unto eternal life. re you willing, dear reader, to receive Christ? then there is no ifficulty in the way; Christ will be your guest; his own power is orking with you, making you willing.

<div class="response">
<p>If we have received Christ himself in our inmost hearts, our new life ill manifest its intimate acquaintance with him by a walk of faith in im. Walking implies action. Our religion is not to be confined to our loset; we must carry out into practical effect that which we believe. f a man walks in Christ, then he so acts as Christ would act; for hrist being in him, his hope, his love, his joy, his life, he is the eflex of the image of Jesus; and men say of that man, "He is like his aster; he lives like Jesus Christ." Walking signifies progress. "So alk ye in him"; proceed from grace to grace, run forward until you each the uttermost degree of knowledge that a man can attain oncerning our Beloved. Walking implies continuance. There must be a erpetual abiding in Christ. How many Christians think that in the orning and evening they ought to come into the company of Jesus, and ay then give their hearts to the world all the day: but this is poor iving; we should always be with him, treading in his steps and doing is will. Walking also implies habit. When we speak of a man's walk and onversation, we mean his habits, the constant tenor of his life. Now, f we sometimes enjoy Christ, and then forget him; sometimes call him urs, and anon lose our hold, that is not a habit; we do not walk in im. We must keep to him, cling to him, never let him go, but live and ave our being in him. "As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so alk ye in him"; persevere in the same way in which ye have begun, and, s at the first Christ Jesus was the trust of your faith, the source of our life, the principle of your action, and the joy of your spirit, so et him be the same till life's end; the same when you walk through the alley of the shadow of death, and enter into the joy and the rest hich remain for the people of God.

</blockquote>
<div class="response">
<p>The word refuge may be translated "mansion," or "abiding- place," which ives the thought that God is our abode, our home. There is a fulness nd sweetness in the metaphor, for dear to our hearts is our home, lthough it be the humblest cottage, or the scantiest garret; and earer far is our blessed God, in whom we live, and move, and have our eing. It is at home that we feel safe: we shut the world out and dwell n quiet security. So when we are with our God we "fear no evil." He is ur shelter and retreat, our abiding refuge. At home, we take our rest; t is there we find repose after the fatigue and toil of the day. And o our hearts find rest in God, when, wearied with life's conflict, we urn to him, and our soul dwells at ease. At home, also, we let our earts loose; we are not afraid of being misunderstood, nor of our ords being misconstrued. So when we are with God we can commune freely ith him, laying open all our hidden desires; for if the "secret of the ord is with them that fear him," the secrets of them that fear him ught to be, and must be, with their Lord. Home, too, is the place of ur truest and purest happiness: and it is in God that our hearts find heir deepest delight. We have joy in him which far surpasses all other oy. It is also for home that we work and labour. The thought of it ives strength to bear the daily burden, and quickens the fingers to erform the task; and in this sense we may also say that God is our ome. Love to him strengthens us. We think of him in the person of his ear Son; and a glimpse of the suffering face of the Redeemer onstrains us to labour in his cause. We feel that we must work, for we ave brethren yet to be saved, and we have our Father's heart to make lad by bringing home his wandering sons; we would fill with holy mirth he sacred family among whom we dwell. Happy are those who have thus he God of Jacob for their refuge!</p>

Under a deep sense of his reat sinfulness, he is humbled before God till he scarcely knows how o pray, because he appears, in his own sight, so worthless. Well, hild of God, remember that when thou art at thy worst and lowest, yet "underneath" thee "are everlasting arms." Sin may drag thee ever so ow, but Christ's great atonement is still under all. You may have escended into the deeps, but you cannot have fallen so low as "the ttermost;" and to the uttermost he saves. Again, the Christian ometimes sinks very deeply in sore trial from without. Every earthly rop is cut away. What then? Still underneath him are "the everlasting rms." He cannot fall so deep in distress and affliction but what the ovenant grace of an ever-faithful God will still encircle him. The hristian may be sinking under trouble from within through fierce onflict, but even then he cannot be brought so low as to be beyond the each of the "everlasting arms"--they are underneath him; and, while hus sustained, all Satan's efforts to harm him avail nothing.</p>
<p>This assurance of support is a comfort to any weary but earnest worker n the service of God. It implies a promise of strength for each day, race for each need, and power for each duty. And, further, when death omes, the promise shall still hold good. When we stand in the midst of ordan, we shall be able to say with David, "I will fear no evil, for hou art with me." We shall descend into the grave, but we shall go no ower, for the eternal arms prevent our further fall. All through life, nd at its close, we shall be upheld by the "everlasting arms"--arms hat neither flag nor lose their strength, for "the everlasting God ainteth not, neither is weary."</p>

When a calm reigns n the sea, spread the sails as you will, the ship moves not to its arbour; for on a slumbering ocean the keel sleeps too. Let the winds ush howling forth, and let the waters lift up themselves, then, though he vessel may rock, and her deck may be washed with waves, and her ast may creak under the pressure of the full and swelling sail, it is hen that she makes headway towards her desired haven. No flowers wear o lovely a blue as those which grow at the foot of the frozen glacier; o stars gleam so brightly as those which glisten in the polar sky; no ater tastes so sweet as that which springs amid the desert sand; and o faith is so precious as that which lives and triumphs in adversity. ried faith brings experience.

The fact of this eminent prayerfulness f Jesus is a lesson for us--he hath given us an example that we may ollow in his steps. The time he chose was admirable, it was the hour f silence, when the crowd would not disturb him; the time of inaction, hen all but himself had ceased to labour; and the season when slumber ade men forget their woes, and cease their applications to him for elief. While others found rest in sleep, he refreshed himself with rayer. The place was also well selected. He was alone where none would ntrude, where none could observe: thus was he free from Pharisaic stentation and vulgar interruption. Those dark and silent hills were a it oratory for the Son of God. Heaven and earth in midnight stillness eard the groans and sighs of the mysterious Being in whom both worlds ere blended. The continuance of his pleadings is remarkable; the long atches were not too long; the cold wind did not chill his devotions; he grim darkness did not darken his faith, or loneliness check his mportunity. We cannot watch with him one hour, but he watched for us hole nights. The occasion for this prayer is notable; it was after his nemies had been enraged--prayer was his refuge and solace; it was efore he sent forth the twelve apostles--prayer was the gate of his nterprise, the herald of his new work. Should we not learn from Jesus o resort to special prayer when we are under peculiar trial, or ontemplate fresh endeavours for the Master's glory? Lord Jesus, teach s to pray.</p>

<p>The branch cannot bear fruit of itself.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>How did you begin to bear fruit? It was when you came to Jesus and cast ourselves on his great atonement, and rested on his finished ighteousness. Ah! what fruit you had then! Do you remember those early ays? Then indeed the vine flourished, the tender grape appeared, the omegranates budded forth, and the beds of spices gave forth their mell. Have you declined since then? If you have, we charge you to emember that time of love, and repent, and do thy first works. Be most n those engagements which you have experimentally proved to draw you earest to Christ, because it is from him that all your fruits proceed. ny holy exercise which will bring you to him will help you to bear ruit. The sun is, no doubt, a great worker in fruit-creating among the rees of the orchard: and Jesus is still more so among the trees of his arden of grace. When have you been the most fruitless? Has not it been hen you have lived farthest from the Lord Jesus Christ, when you have lackened in prayer, when you have departed from the simplicity of your aith, when your graces have engrossed your attention instead of your ord, when you have said, "My mountain standeth firm, I shall never be oved"; and have forgotten where your strength dwells--has not it been hen that your fruit has ceased? Some of us have been taught that we ave nothing out of Christ, by terrible abasements of heart before the ord; and when we have seen the utter barrenness and death of all reature power, we have cried in anguish, "From him all my fruit must e found, for no fruit can ever come from me." We are taught, by past xperience, that the more simply we depend upon the grace of God in hrist, and wait upon the Holy Spirit, the more we shall bring forth ruit unto God. Oh! to trust Jesus for fruit as well as for life.</p>

<p>If men ought always to pray and not to faint, much more Christian men. esus has sent his church into the world on the same errand upon which e himself came, and this mission includes intercession. What if I say hat the church is the world's priest? Creation is dumb, but the church s to find a mouth for it. It is the church's high privilege to pray ith acceptance. The door of grace is always open for her petitions, nd they never return empty-handed. The veil was rent for her, the lood was sprinkled upon the altar for her, God constantly invites her o ask what she wills. Will she refuse the privilege which angels might nvy her? Is she not the bride of Christ? May she not go in unto her ing at every hour? Shall she allow the precious privilege to be nused? The church always has need for prayer. There are always some in er midst who are declining, or falling into open sin. There are lambs o be prayed for, that they may be carried in Christ's bosom? the trong, lest they grow presumptuous; and the weak, lest they become espairing. If we kept up prayer-meetings four-and-twenty hours in the ay, all the days in the year, we might never be without a special ubject for supplication. Are we ever without the sick and the poor, he afflicted and the wavering? Are we ever without those who seek the onversion of relatives, the reclaiming of back-sliders, or the alvation of the depraved? Nay, with congregations constantly athering, with ministers always preaching, with millions of sinners ying dead in trespasses and sins; in a country over which the darkness f Romanism is certainly descending; in a world full of idols, ruelties, devilries, if the church doth not pray, how shall she excuse er base neglect of the commission of her loving Lord?

<p>Such persons thought themselves safe because they were with both arties: they went with the followers of Jehovah, and bowed at the same ime to Malcham. But duplicity is abominable with God, and hypocrisy is soul hateth. The idolater who distinctly gives himself to his false od, has one sin less than he who brings his polluted and detestable acrifice unto the temple of the Lord, while his heart is with the orld and the sins thereof. To hold with the hare and run with the ounds, is a dastard's policy. In the common matters of daily life, a ouble- minded man is despised, but in religion he is loathsome to the ast degree. The penalty pronounced in the verse before us is terrible, ut it is well deserved; for how should divine justice spare the inner, who knows the right, approves it, and professes to follow it, nd all the while loves the evil, and gives it dominion in his heart?</p>
<p>My soul, search thyself this morning, and see whether thou art guilty f double-dealing. Thou professest to be a follower of Jesus--dost thou ruly love him? Is thy heart right with God? Art thou of the family of ld Father Honest, or art thou a relative of Mr. By-ends? A name to ive is of little value if I be indeed dead in trespasses and sins. To ave one foot on the land of truth, and another on the sea of alsehood, will involve a terrible fall and a total ruin. Christ will e all or nothing. God fills the whole universe, and hence there is no oom for another god; if, then, he reigns in my heart, there will be no pace for another reigning power. Do I rest alone on Jesus crucified, nd live alone for him? Is it my desire to do so? Is my heart set upon o doing? If so, blessed be the mighty grace which has led me to alvation; and if not so, O Lord, pardon my sad offence, and unite my eart to fear thy name.</p>

<p>We do not excuse Laban for his dishonesty, but we scruple not to learn rom the custom which he quoted as his excuse. There are some things hich must be taken in order, and if we would win the second we must ecure the first. The second may be the more lovely in our eyes, but he rule of the heavenly country must stand, and the elder must be arried first. For instance, many men desire the beautiful and ell-favoured Rachel of joy and peace in believing, but they must first e wedded to the tender-eyed Leah of repentance. Every one falls in ove with happiness, and many would cheerfully serve twice seven years o enjoy it, but according to the rule of the Lord's kingdom, the Leah f real holiness must be beloved of our soul before the Rachel of true appiness can be attained. Heaven stands not first but second, and only y persevering to the end can we win a portion in it. The cross must be arried before the crown can be worn. We must follow our Lord in his umiliation, or we shall never rest with him in glory.</p>
<p>My soul, what sayest thou, art thou so vain as to hope to break through he heavenly rule? Dost thou hope for reward without labour, or honour ithout toil?

In such a spirit, labouring and suffering, hou wilt find bitters grow sweet, and hard things easy. Like Jacob, hy years of service will seem unto thee but a few days for the love hou hast to Jesus; and when the dear hour of the wedding feast shall ome, all thy toils shall be as though they had never been--an hour ith Jesus will make up for ages of pain and labour.</p>

<p>It is our wisdom, as well as our necessity, to beseech God continually o strengthen that which he has wrought in us.

We ften forget that the Author of our faith must be the Preserver of it lso.

It is a secret hich no other man knoweth; nay, which the very man who is the ossessor of it cannot tell to his neighbour. The text includes not nly secrecy, but separation. It is not the common spring, of which very passer-by may drink, it is one kept and preserved from all thers; it is a fountain bearing a particular mark--a king's royal eal, so that all can perceive that it is not a common fountain, but a ountain owned by a proprietor, and placed specially by itself alone. o is it with the spiritual life. The chosen of God were separated in he eternal decree; they were separated by God in the day of edemption; and they are separated by the possession of a life which thers have not; and it is impossible for them to feel at home with the orld, or to delight in its pleasures. There is also the idea of acredness. The spring shut up is preserved for the use of some special erson: and such is the Christian's heart. It is a spring kept for esus. Every Christian should feel that he has God's seal upon him--and e should be able to say with Paul, "From henceforth let no man trouble e, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."

A ypocrite, when afflicted by God, resents the infliction, and, like a lave, would run from the Master who has scourged him; but not so the rue heir of heaven, he kisses the hand which smote him, and seeks helter from the rod in the bosom of the God who frowned upon him. ob's desire to commune with God was intensified by the failure of all ther sources of consolation. The patriarch turned away from his sorry riends, and looked up to the celestial throne, just as a traveller urns from his empty skin bottle, and betakes himself with all speed to he well. He bids farewell to earth-born hopes, and cries, "O that I new where I might find my God!" Nothing teaches us so much the reciousness of the Creator, as when we learn the emptiness of all esides. Turning away with bitter scorn from earth's hives, where we ind no honey, but many sharp stings, we rejoice in him whose faithful ord is sweeter than honey or the honeycomb. In every trouble we should irst seek to realize God's presence with us. Only let us enjoy his mile, and we can bear our daily cross with a willing heart for his ear sake.</p>

<p>Observe how positively the prophet speaks. He doth not say, "I hope, I rust, I sometimes think, that God hath pleaded the causes of my soul;" but he speaks of it as a matter of fact not to be disputed. "Thou hast leaded the causes of my soul." Let us, by the aid of the gracious omforter, shake off those doubts and fears which so much mar our peace nd comfort. Be this our prayer, that we may have done with the harsh roaking voice of surmise and suspicion, and may be able to speak with he clear, melodious voice of full assurance. Notice how gratefully the rophet speaks, ascribing all the glory to God alone! You perceive here is not a word concerning himself or his own pleadings. He doth ot ascribe his deliverance in any measure to any man, much less to his wn merit; but it is "thou"--"O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of y soul; thou hast redeemed my life." A grateful spirit should ever be ultivated by the Christian; and especially after deliverances we hould prepare a song for our God. Earth should be a temple filled with he songs of grateful saints, and every day should be a censor smoking ith the sweet incense of thanksgiving. How joyful Jeremiah seems to be hile he records the Lord's mercy. How triumphantly he lifts up the train! He has been in the low dungeon, and is even now no other than he weeping prophet; and yet in the very book which is called
<p>"Lamentations," clear as the song of Miriam when she dashed her fingers gainst the tabor, shrill as the note of Deborah when she met Barak ith shouts of victory, we hear the voice of Jeremy going up to eaven--"Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my ife." O children of God, seek after a vital experience of the Lord's ovingkindness, and when you have it, speak positively of it; sing ratefully; shout triumphantly.</p></p>

<p>Jacob, while expostulating with Laban, thus describes his own toil, "This twenty years have I been with thee.

Thus I was; in he day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep eparted from mine eyes." Even more toilsome than this was the life of ur Saviour here below. He watched over all his sheep till he gave in s his last account, "Of all those whom thou hast given me I have lost one." His hair was wet with dew, and his locks with the drops of the ight. Sleep departed from his eyes, for all night he was in prayer restling for his people. One night Peter must be pleaded for; anon, nother claims his tearful intercession. No shepherd sitting beneath he cold skies, looking up to the stars, could ever utter such omplaints because of the hardness of his toil as Jesus Christ might ave brought, if he had chosen to do so, because of the sternness of is service in order to procure his spouse--</p>

<p>It is sweet to dwell upon the spiritual parallel of Laban having equired all the sheep at Jacob's hand. If they were torn of beasts, acob must make it good; if any of them died, he must stand as surety or the whole. Was not the toil of Jesus for his Church the toil of one ho was under suretiship obligations to bring every believing one safe o the hand of him who had committed them to his charge? Look upon oiling Jacob, and you see a representation of him of whom we read, "He hall feed his flock like a shepherd."</p>

The octrine is the basis of the experience, but as the flower is more ovely than the root, so is the experience of fellowship with the risen aviour more lovely than the doctrine itself. I would have you believe hat Christ rose from the dead so as to sing of it, and derive all the onsolation which it is possible for you to extract from this ell-ascertained and well-witnessed fact; but I beseech you, rest not ontented even there. Though you cannot, like the disciples, see him isibly, yet I bid you aspire to see Christ Jesus by the eye of faith; nd though, like Mary Magdalene, you may not "touch" him, yet may you e privileged to converse with him, and to know that he is risen, you ourselves being risen in him to newness of life. To know a crucified aviour as having crucified all my sins, is a high degree of knowledge; ut to know a risen Saviour as having justified me, and to realize that e has bestowed upon me new life, having given me to be a new creature hrough his own newness of life, this is a noble style of experience: hort of it, none ought to rest satisfied.

He makes thee free, but it is by his own bonds. hou goest clear, because he bare thy burden for thee: thou art set at iberty, because he has suffered in thy stead. But, though dearly urchased, he freely gives it. Jesus asks nothing of us as a reparation for this liberty.

Foolish and impudent are all those discourses about he rights of men to be all placed on the same footing; ignorant, if ot worse, are those contentions against discriminating grace, which re but the rebellions of proud human nature against the crown and ceptre of Jehovah.

Here is the comfort of every eliever in the Lord Jesus; let the work of grace be ever so small in ts beginnings, the plummet is in good hands, a master builder greater han Solomon has undertaken the raising of the heavenly temple, and he ill not fail nor be discouraged till the topmost pinnacle shall be aised. If the plummet were in the hand of any merely human being, we ight fear for the building, but the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper n Jesus' hand. The works did not proceed irregularly, and without are, for the master's hand carried a good instrument. Had the walls een hurriedly run up without due superintendence, they might have been ut of the perpendicular; but the plummet was used by the chosen verseer. Jesus is evermore watching the erection of his spiritual emple, that it may be built securely and well. We are for haste, but esus is for judgment. He will use the plummet, and that which is out f line must come down, every stone of it. Hence the failure of many a lattering work, the overthrow of many a glittering profession. It is ot for us to judge the Lord's church, since Jesus has a steady hand, nd a true eye, and can use the plummet well. Do we not rejoice to see udgment left to him?</p>
<p>The plummet was in active use--it was in the builder's hand; a sure ndication that he meant to push on the work to completion. O Lord esus, how would we indeed be glad if we could see thee at thy great ork. O Zion, the beautiful, thy walls are still in ruins! Rise, thou lorious Builder, and make her desolations to rejoice at thy coming.</p>

<p>Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>In Joshua the high priest we see a picture of each and every child of od, who has been made nigh by the blood of Christ, and has been taught o minister in holy things, and enter into that which is within the eil. Jesus has made us priests and kings unto God, and even here upon arth we exercise the priesthood of consecrated living and hallowed ervice. But this high priest is said to be "standing before the angel f the Lord," that is, standing to minister. This should be the erpetual position of every true believer. Every place is now God's emple, and his people can as truly serve him in their daily mployments as in his house. They are to be always "ministering," offering the spiritual sacrifice of prayer and praise, and presenting hemselves a "living sacrifice." But notice where it is that Joshua tands to minister, it is before the angel of Jehovah. It is only hrough a mediator that we poor defiled ones can ever become priests nto God. I present what I have before the messenger, the angel of the ovenant, the Lord Jesus; and through him my prayers find acceptance rapped up in his prayers; my praises become sweet as they are bound up ith bundles of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia from Christ's own garden. f I can bring him nothing but my tears, he will put them with his own ears in his own bottle for he once wept; if I can bring him nothing ut my groans and sighs, he will accept these as an acceptable acrifice, for he once was broken in heart, and sighed heavily in pirit. I myself, standing in him, am accepted in the Beloved; and all y polluted works, though in themselves only objects of divine bhorrence, are so received, that God smelleth a sweet savour. He is ontent and I am blessed. See, then, the position of the Christian--"a riest--standing--before the angel of the Lord."</p>

<p>Could there be a sweeter word in any language than that word "forgiveness," when it sounds in a guilty sinner's ear, like the silver otes of jubilee to the captive Israelite? Blessed, forever blessed be hat dear star of pardon which shines into the condemned cell, and ives the perishing a gleam of hope amid the midnight of despair! Can t be possible that sin, such sin as mine, can be forgiven, forgiven ltogether, and forever? Hell is my portion as a sinner--there is no ossibility of my escaping from it while sin remains upon me--can the oad of guilt be uplifted, the crimson stain removed? Can the damantine stones of my prison-house ever be loosed from their ortices, or the doors be lifted from their hinges? Jesus tells me that  may yet be clear. Forever blessed be the revelation of atoning love hich not only tells me that pardon is possible, but that it is secured o all who rest in Jesus. I have believed in the appointed ropitiation, even Jesus crucified, and therefore my sins are at this oment, and forever, forgiven by virtue of his substitutionary pains nd death. What joy is this! What bliss to be a perfectly pardoned oul! My soul dedicates all her powers to him who of his own npurchased love became my surety, and wrought out for me redemption hrough his blood. What riches of grace does free forgiveness exhibit! o forgive at all, to forgive fully, to forgive freely, to forgive orever! Here is a constellation of wonders; and when I think of how reat my sins were, how dear were the precious drops which cleansed me rom them, and how gracious was the method by which pardon was sealed ome to me, I am in a maze of wondering worshipping affection. I bow efore the throne which absolves me, I clasp the cross which delivers e, I serve henceforth all my days the Incarnate God, through whom I am his night a pardoned soul.</p>

<p>The truth was in Gaius, and Gaius walked in the truth. If the first had ot been the case, the second could never have occurred; and if the econd could not be said of him the first would have been a mere retence. Truth must enter into the soul, penetrate and saturate it, or lse it is of no value. Doctrines held as a matter of creed are like read in the hand, which ministers no nourishment to the frame; but octrine accepted by the heart, is as food digested, which, by ssimilation, sustains and builds up the body. In us truth must be a iving force, an active energy, an indwelling reality, a part of the oof and warp of our being. If it be in us, we cannot henceforth part ith it. A man may lose his garments or his limbs, but his inward parts re vital, and cannot be torn away without absolute loss of life. A hristian can die, but he cannot deny the truth. Now it is a rule of ature that the inward affects the outward, as light shines from the entre of the lantern through the glass: when, therefore, the truth is indled within, its brightness soon beams forth in the outward life and onversation. It is said that the food of certain worms colours the ocoons of silk which they spin: and just so the nutriment upon which a an's inward nature lives gives a tinge to every word and deed roceeding from him. To walk in the truth, imports a life of integrity, oliness, faithfulness, and simplicity--the natural product of those rinciples of truth which the gospel teaches, and which the Spirit of od enables us to receive. We may judge of the secrets of the soul by heir manifestation in the man's conversation. Be it ours today, O racious Spirit, to be ruled and governed by thy divine authority, so hat nothing false or sinful may reign in our hearts, lest it extend ts malignant influence to our daily walk among men.</p>

In this he was a type of Jesus, who, upon his hrone of glory, seeks not his own, but spends his power for his eople. It were well if every Christian would be a Mordecai to the hurch, striving according to his ability for its prosperity. Some are laced in stations of affluence and influence, let them honour their ord in the high places of the earth, and testify for Jesus before reat men. Others have what is far better, namely, close fellowship ith the King of kings, let them be sure to plead daily for the weak of he Lord's people, the doubting, the tempted, and the comfortless. It ill redound to their honour if they make much intercession for those ho are in darkness and dare not draw nigh unto the mercy seat. nstructed believers may serve their Master greatly if they lay out heir talents for the general good, and impart their wealth of heavenly earning to others, by teaching them the things of God. The very least n our Israel may at least seek the welfare of his people; and his esire, if he can give no more, shall be acceptable. It is at once the ost Christlike and the most happy course for a believer to cease from iving to himself. He who blesses others cannot fail to be blessed imself. On the other hand, to seek our own personal greatness is a icked and unhappy plan of life, its way will be grievous and its end ill be fatal.</p>

<p>Tale-bearing emits a threefold poison; for it injures the teller, the earer, and the person concerning whom the tale is told. Whether the eport be true or false, we are by this precept of God's Word forbidden o spread it. The reputations of the Lord's people should be very recious in our sight, and we should count it shame to help the devil o dishonour the Church and the name of the Lord. Some tongues need a ridle rather than a spur. Many glory in pulling down their brethren, s if thereby they raised themselves. Noah's wise sons cast a mantle ver their father, and he who exposed him earned a fearful curse. We ay ourselves one of these dark days need forbearance and silence from ur brethren, let us render it cheerfully to those who require it now. e this our family rule, and our personal bond--Speak evil of no man.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit, however, permits us to censure sin, and prescribes the ay in which we are to do it. It must be done by rebuking our brother o his face, not by railing behind his back. This course is manly, rotherly, Christlike, and under God's blessing will be useful. Does he flesh shrink from it? Then we must lay the greater stress upon our onscience, and keep ourselves to the work, lest by suffering sin upon ur friend we become ourselves partakers of it. Hundreds have been aved from gross sins by the timely, wise, affectionate warnings of aithful ministers and brethren.

<p>Much use was made of this anointing oil under the law, and that which t represents is of primary importance under the gospel. The Holy pirit, who anoints us for all holy service, is indispensable to us if e would serve the Lord acceptably. Without his aid our religious ervices are but a vain oblation, and our inward experience is a dead hing. Whenever our ministry is without unction, what miserable stuff t becomes! nor are the prayers, praises, meditations, and efforts of rivate Christians one jot superior. A holy anointing is the soul and ife of piety, its absence the most grievous of all calamities. To go efore the Lord without anointing is as though some common Levite had hrust himself into the priest's office--his ministrations would rather ave been sins than services. May we never venture upon hallowed xercises without sacred anointings. They drop upon us from our lorious Head; from his anointing we who are as the skirts of his arments partake of a plenteous unction. Choice spices were compounded ith rarest art of the apothecary to form the anointing oil, to show orth to us how rich are all the influences of the Holy Spirit.

<p>A very important question this seemed to be to the king of Judah, and ossibly it is of even more weight with the tried and tempted O hristian. To lose money is at no times pleasant, and when principle nvolves it, the flesh is not always ready to make the sacrifice. "Why ose that which may be so usefully employed? May not the truth itself e bought too dear? What shall we do without it? Remember the children, nd our small income!" All these things and a thousand more would tempt he Christian to put forth his hand to unrighteous gain, or stay imself from carrying out his conscientious convictions, when they nvolve serious loss. All men cannot view these matters in the light of aith; and even with the followers of Jesus, the doctrine of "we must ive" has quite sufficient weight.</p>
<p>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this is a very atisfactory answer to the anxious question. Our Father holds the urse-strings, and what we lose for his sake he can repay a housand-fold. It is ours to obey his will, and we may rest assured hat he will provide for us. The Lord will be no man's debtor at the ast. Saints know that a grain of heart's-ease is of more value than a on of gold. He who wraps a threadbare coat about a good conscience has ained a spiritual wealth far more desirable than any he has lost. od's smile and a dungeon are enough for a true heart; his frown and a alace would be hell to a gracious spirit. Let the worst come to the orst, let all the talents go, we have not lost our treasure, for that s above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Meanwhile, ven now, the Lord maketh the meek to inherit the earth, and no good hing doth he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</p>

Jesus will always be the dragon's foe, and that ot in a quiet sense, but actively, vigorously, with full determination o exterminate evil. All his servants, whether angels in heaven or essengers on earth, will and must fight; they are born to be arriors--at the cross they enter into covenant never to make truce ith evil; they are a warlike company, firm in defence and fierce in ttack. The duty of every soldier in the army of the Lord is daily, ith all his heart, and soul, and strength, to fight against the ragon.</p>
<p>The dragon and his angels will not decline the affray; they are ncessant in their onslaughts, sparing no weapon, fair or foul. We are oolish to expect to serve God without opposition: the more zealous we re, the more sure are we to be assailed by the myrmidons of hell.

<p>The Lord's admiration of his Church is very wonderful, and his escription of her beauty is very glowing. She is not merely fair, but "all fair." He views her in himself, washed in his sin-atoning blood nd clothed in his meritorious righteousness, and he considers her to e full of comeliness and beauty. No wonder that such is the case, ince it is but his own perfect excellency that he admires; for the oliness, glory, and perfection of his Church are his own glorious arments on the back of his own well-beloved spouse. She is not simply ure, or well-proportioned; she is positively lovely and fair! She has ctual merit! Her deformities of sin are removed; but more, she has hrough her Lord obtained a meritorious righteousness by which an ctual beauty is conferred upon her. Believers have a positive ighteousness given to them when they become "accepted in the beloved"
(Eph. 1:6). Nor is the Church barely lovely, she is superlatively so. er Lord styles her "Thou fairest among women." She has a real worth nd excellence which cannot be rivalled by all the nobility and royalty f the world. If Jesus could exchange his elect bride for all the ueens and empresses of earth, or even for the angels in heaven, he ould not, for he puts her first and foremost--"fairest among women."</p>

Solomon, the wisest of men, as permitted to make experiments for us all, and to do for us what we ust not dare to do for ourselves. Here is his testimony in his own ords: "So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me n Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. And whatsoever mine eyes esired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for y heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my abour. Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and n the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity nd vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun." "Vanity f vanities, all is vanity." What! the whole of it vanity? O favoured onarch, is there nothing in all thy wealth? Nothing in that wide ominion reaching from the river even to the sea? Nothing in Palmyra's lorious palaces? Nothing in the house of the forest of Lebanon? In all hy music and dancing, and wine and luxury, is there nothing? "Nothing," he says, "but weariness of spirit." This was his verdict hen he had trodden the whole round of pleasure. To embrace our Lord esus, to dwell in his love, and be fully assured of union with im--this is all in all. Dear reader, you need not try other forms of ife in order to see whether they are better than the Christian's: if ou roam the world around, you will see no sights like a sight of the aviour's face; if you could have all the comforts of life, if you lost our Saviour, you would be wretched; but if you win Christ, then should ou rot in a dungeon, you would find it a paradise; should you live in bscurity, or die with famine, you will yet be satisfied with favour nd full of the goodness of the Lord.</p>

<p>Having pronounced his Church positively full of beauty, our Lord onfirms his praise by a precious negative, "There is no spot in thee." As if the thought occurred to the Bridegroom that the carping world ould insinuate that he had only mentioned her comely parts, and had urposely omitted those features which were deformed or defiled, he ums up all by declaring her universally and entirely fair, and utterly evoid of stain. A spot may soon be removed, and is the very least hing that can disfigure beauty, but even from this little blemish the eliever is delivered in his Lord's sight. If he had said there is no ideous scar, no horrible deformity, no deadly ulcer, we might even hen have marvelled; but when he testifies that she is free from the lightest spot, all these other forms of defilement are included, and he depth of wonder is increased. If he had but promised to remove all pots by-and-by, we should have had eternal reason for joy; but when he peaks of it as already done, who can restrain the most intense motions of satisfaction and delight? O my soul, here is marrow and atness for thee; eat thy full, and be satisfied with royal dainties.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus has no quarrel with his spouse. She often wanders from im, and grieves his Holy Spirit, but he does not allow her faults to ffect his love. He sometimes chides, but it is always in the tenderest anner, with the kindest intentions: it is "my love" even then. There s no remembrance of our follies, he does not cherish ill thoughts of s, but he pardons and loves as well after the offence as before it. It s well for us it is so, for if Jesus were as mindful of injuries as we re, how could he commune with us? Many a time a believer will put imself out of humour with the Lord for some slight turn in providence, ut our precious Husband knows our silly hearts too well to take any ffence at our ill manners.</p>

<p>Well may our God be glorious in the eyes of his people, seeing that he as wrought such wonders for them, in them, and by them. For them, the ord Jesus upon Calvary routed every foe, breaking all the weapons of he enemy in pieces by his finished work of satisfactory obedience; by is triumphant resurrection and ascension he completely overturned the opes of hell, leading captivity captive, making a show of our enemies penly, triumphing over them by his cross. Every arrow of guilt which atan might have shot at us is broken, for who can lay anything to the harge of God's elect? Vain are the sharp swords of infernal malice, nd the perpetual battles of the serpent's seed, for in the midst of he church the lame take the prey, and the feeblest warriors are rowned.</p>
<p>The saved may well adore their Lord for his conquests in them, since he arrows of their natural hatred are snapped, and the weapons of heir rebellion broken. What victories has grace won in our evil earts! How glorious is Jesus when the will is subdued, and sin ethroned! As for our remaining corruptions, they shall sustain an qually sure defeat, and every temptation, and doubt, and fear, shall e utterly destroyed. In the Salem of our peaceful hearts, the name of esus is great beyond compare: he has won our love, and he shall wear t. Even thus securely may we look for victories by us. We are more han conquerors through him that loved us. We shall cast down the owers of darkness which are in the world, by our faith, and zeal, and oliness; we shall win sinners to Jesus, we shall overturn false ystems, we shall convert nations, for God is with us, and none shall tand before us. This evening let the Christian warrior chant the war ong, and prepare for to-morrow's fight. Greater is he that is in us han he that is in the world.</p>

<p>This should be a great encouragement to try to do good, since God has mong the vilest of the vile, the most reprobate, the most debauched nd drunken, an elect people who must be saved. When you take the Word o them, you do so because God has ordained you to be the messenger of ife to their souls, and they must receive it, for so the decree of redestination runs. They are as much redeemed by blood as the saints efore the eternal throne. They are Christ's property, and yet perhaps hey are lovers of the ale-house, and haters of holiness; but if Jesus hrist purchased them he will have them. God is not unfaithful to orget the price which his Son has paid. He will not suffer his ubstitution to be in any case an ineffectual, dead thing. Tens of housands of redeemed ones are not regenerated yet, but regenerated hey must be; and this is our comfort when we go forth to them with the uickening Word of God.</p>
<p>Nay, more, these ungodly ones are prayed for by Christ before the hrone. "Neither pray I for these alone," saith the great Intercessor, "but for them also which shall believe on me through their word." Poor, gnorant souls, they know nothing about prayer for themselves, but esus prays for them. Their names are on his breastplate, and ere long hey must bow their stubborn knee, breathing the penitential sigh efore the throne of grace. "The time of figs is not yet." The redestinated moment has not struck; but, when it comes, they shall bey, for God will have his own; they must, for the Spirit is not to be ithstood when he cometh forth with fulness of power--they must become he willing servants of the living God. "My people shall be willing in he day of my power." "He shall justify many." "He shall see of the ravail of his soul."

<div class="response">
<p>This groaning is universal among the saints: to a greater or less xtent we all feel it. It is not the groan of murmuring or complaint: t is rather the note of desire than of distress. Having received an arnest, we desire the whole of our portion; we are sighing that our ntire manhood, in its trinity of spirit, soul, and body, may be set ree from the last vestige of the fall; we long to put off corruption, eakness, and dishonour, and to wrap ourselves in incorruption, in mmortality, in glory, in the spiritual body which the Lord Jesus will estow upon his people. We long for the manifestation of our adoption s the children of God. "We groan," but it is "within ourselves." It is ot the hypocrite's groan, by which he would make men believe that he s a saint because he is wretched. Our sighs are sacred things, too allowed for us to tell abroad. We keep our longings to our Lord alone. hen the apostle says we are "waiting," by which we learn that we are ot to be petulant, like Jonah or Elijah, when they said, "Let me die"; or are we to whimper and sigh for the end of life because we are tired f work, nor wish to escape from our present sufferings till the will f the Lord is done. We are to groan for glorification, but we are to ait patiently for it, knowing that what the Lord appoints is best. aiting implies being ready. We are to stand at the door expecting the eloved to open it and take us away to himself. This "groaning" is a est. You may judge of a man by what he groans after. Some men groan fter wealth--they worship Mammon; some groan continually under the roubles of life--they are merely impatient; but the man who sighs fter God, who is uneasy till he is made like Christ, that is the lessed man. May God help us to groan for the coming of the Lord, and he resurrection which he will bring to us.</p>

<p>In the vision described in this chapter, the prophet saw four terrible orns.

He aw before him a representation of those powers which had oppressed the hurch of God. There were four horns; for the church is attacked from ll quarters. Well might the prophet have felt dismayed; but on a udden there appeared before him four carpenters. He asked, "What shall hese do?" These are the men whom God hath found to break those horns n pieces. God will always find men for his work, and he will find them t the right time. The prophet did not see the carpenters first, when here was nothing to do, but first the "horns," and then the "carpenters." Moreover, the Lord finds enough men. He did not find hree carpenters, but four; there were four horns, and there must be our workmen.

<p>"One like unto the Son of Man" appeared to John in Patmos, and the eloved disciple marked that he wore a girdle of gold. A girdle, for esus never was ungirt while upon earth, but stood always ready for ervice, and now before the eternal throne he stays not His holy inistry, but as a priest is girt about with "the curious girdle of the phod." Well it is for us that he has not ceased to fulfil his offices f love for us, since this is one of our choicest safeguards that he ver liveth to make intercession for us. Jesus is never an idler; his arments are never loose as though his offices were ended; he iligently carries on the cause of his people. A golden girdle, to anifest the superiority of his service, the royalty of his person, the ignity of his state, the glory of his reward. No longer does he cry ut of the dust, but he pleads with authority, a King as well as a riest. Safe enough is our cause in the hands of our enthroned elchizedek.</p>
<p>Our Lord presents all his people with an example. We must never unbind ur girdles. This is not the time for lying down at ease, it is the eason of service and warfare. We need to bind the girdle of truth more nd more tightly around our loins. It is a golden girdle, and so will e our richest ornament, and we greatly need it, for a heart that is ot well braced up with the truth as it is in Jesus, and with the idelity which is wrought of the Spirit, will be easily entangled with he things of this life, and tripped up by the snares of temptation. It s in vain that we possess the Scriptures unless we bind them around us ike a girdle, surrounding our entire nature, keeping each part of our haracter in order, and giving compactness to our whole man. If in eaven Jesus unbinds not the girdle, much less may we upon earth. tand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.</p>

Then et us amend our ways, for of what avail will it be at the last great ay to have taught and moralized men if they appear before God unsaved? lood-red will our skirts be if through life we have sought inferior bjects, and forgotten that men needed to be saved. Paul knew the ruin f man's natural state, and did not try to educate him, but to save im; he saw men sinking to hell, and did not talk of refining them, but f saving from the wrath to come. To compass their salvation, he gave imself up with untiring zeal to telling abroad the gospel, to warning nd beseeching men to be reconciled to God. His prayers were mportunate and his labours incessant. To save souls was his consuming assion, his ambition, his calling. He became a servant to all men, oiling for his race, feeling a woe within him if he preached not the ospel. He laid aside his preferences to prevent prejudice; he ubmitted his will in things indifferent, and if men would but receive he gospel, he raised no questions about forms or ceremonies: the ospel was the one all-important business with him. If he might save ome he would be content. This was the crown for which he strove, the ole and sufficient reward of all his labours and self-denials. Dear eader, have you and I lived to win souls at this noble rate? Are we ossessed with the same all-absorbing desire? If not, why not? Jesus ied for sinners, cannot we live for them?

<p>In Lydia's conversion there are many points of interest. It was brought bout by providential circumstances. She was a seller of purple, of the ity of Thyatira, but just at the right time for hearing Paul we find er at Philippi; providence, which is the handmaid of grace, led her to he right spot. Again, grace was preparing her soul for the lessing--grace preparing for grace. She did not know the Saviour, but s a Jewess, she knew many truths which were excellent stepping-stones o a knowledge of Jesus. Her conversion took place in the use of the eans. On the Sabbath she went when prayer was wont to be made, and here prayer was heard. Never neglect the means of grace; God may bless s when we are not in his house, but we have the greater reason to hope hat he will when we are in communion with his saints. Observe the ords, "Whose heart the Lord opened." She did not open her own heart. er prayers did not do it; Paul did not do it. The Lord himself must pen the heart, to receive the things which make for our peace. He lone can put the key into the hole of the door and open it, and get dmittance for himself. He is the heart's master as he is the heart's aker. The first outward evidence of the opened heart was obedience. As oon as Lydia had believed in Jesus, she was baptized. It is a sweet ign of a humble and broken heart, when the child of God is willing to bey a command which is not essential to his salvation, which is not orced upon him by a selfish fear of condemnation, but is a simple act f obedience and of communion with his Master. The next evidence was ove, manifesting itself in acts of grateful kindness to the apostles. ove to the saints has ever been a mark of the true convert. Those who o nothing for Christ or his church, give but sorry evidence of an "opened" heart. Lord, evermore give me an opened heart.</p>

<p>To what choice order of officials was this word spoken? To kings who roudly boast a right divine? Ah, no! too often do they serve hemselves or Satan, and forget the God whose sufferance permits them o wear their mimic majesty for their little hour. Speaks then the postle to those so-called "right reverend fathers in God," the ishops, or "the venerable the archdeacons"? No, indeed, Paul knew othing of these mere inventions of man. Not even to pastors and eachers, or to the wealthy and esteemed among believers, was this word poken, but to servants, aye, and to slaves. Among the toiling ultitudes, the journeymen, the day labourers, the domestic servants, he drudges of the kitchen, the apostle found, as we find still, some f the Lord's chosen, and to them he says, "Whatsoever ye do, do it eartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye hall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord hrist." This saying ennobles the weary routine of earthly employments, nd sheds a halo around the most humble occupations. To wash feet may e servile, but to wash his feet is royal work. To unloose the hoe-latchet is poor employ, but to unloose the great Master's shoe is  princely privilege. The shop, the barn, the scullery, and the smithy ecome temples when men and women do all to the glory of God! Then "divine service" is not a thing of a few hours and a few places, but ll life becomes holiness unto the Lord, and every place and thing, as onsecrated as the tabernacle and its golden candlestick.</p>
<p>"Teach me, my God and King, in all things thee to see;</p>
<p>And what I do in anything to do it as to thee.</p>
<p>All may of thee partake, nothing can be so mean,</p>
<p>Which with this tincture, for thy sake, will not grow bright and clean.</p>
<p>A servant with this clause makes drudgery divine;</p>
<p>Who sweeps a room, as for thy laws, makes that and the action fine."</p>

<p>What he hath done at one time, he will do yet again. Man's ways are ariable, but God's ways are everlasting. There are many reasons for his most comforting truth: among them are the following--the Lord's ays are the result of wise deliberation; he ordereth all things ccording to the counsel of his own will. Human action is frequently he hasty result of passion, or fear, and is followed by regret and lteration; but nothing can take the Almighty by surprise, or happen therwise than he has foreseen. His ways are the outgrowth of an mmutable character, and in them the fixed and settled attributes of od are clearly to be seen. Unless the Eternal One himself can undergo hange, his ways, which are himself in action, must remain forever the ame. Is he eternally just, gracious, faithful, wise, tender?--then his ays must ever be distinguished for the same excellences. Beings act ccording to their nature: when those natures change, their conduct aries also; but since God cannot know the shadow of a turning, his ays will abide everlastingly the same. Moreover there is no reason rom without which could reverse the divine ways, since they are the mbodiment of irresistible might. The earth is said, by the prophet, to e cleft with rivers, mountains tremble, the deep lifts up its hands, nd sun and moon stand still, when Jehovah marches forth for the alvation of his people. Who can stay his hand, or say unto him, What oest thou? But it is not might alone which gives stability; God's ways re the manifestation of the eternal principles of right, and therefore an never pass away. Wrong breeds decay and involves ruin, but the true nd the good have about them a vitality which ages cannot diminish.</p>
<p>This morning let us go to our heavenly Father with confidence, emembering that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and orever, and in him the Lord is ever gracious to his people.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Salt was used in every offering made by fire unto the Lord, and from ts preserving and purifying properties it was the grateful emblem of ivine grace in the soul. It is worthy of our attentive regard that, hen Artaxerxes gave salt to Ezra the priest, he set no limit to the uantity, and we may be quite certain that when the King of kings istributes grace among his royal priesthood, the supply is not cut hort by him. Often are we straitened in ourselves, but never in the ord. He who chooses to gather much manna will find that he may have as uch as he desires. There is no such famine in Jerusalem that the itizens should eat their bread by weight and drink their water by easure. Some things in the economy of grace are measured; for instance ur vinegar and gall are given us with such exactness that we never ave a single drop too much, but of the salt of grace no stint is made, "Ask what thou wilt and it shall be given unto thee." Parents need to ock up the fruit cupboard, and the sweet jars, but there is no need to eep the salt-box under lock and key, for few children will eat too reedily from that. A man may have too much money, or too much honour, ut he cannot have too much grace. When Jeshurun waxed fat in the lesh, he kicked against God, but there is no fear of a man's becoming oo full of grace: a plethora of grace is impossible. More wealth rings more care, but more grace brings more joy. Increased wisdom is ncreased sorrow, but abundance of the Spirit is fulness of joy. eliever, go to the throne for a large supply of heavenly salt. It will eason thine afflictions, which are unsavoury without salt; it will reserve thy heart which corrupts if salt be absent, and it will kill hy sins even as salt kills reptiles. Thou needest much; seek much, and ave much.</p>

<p>The church is most instructively symbolized by a building erected by eavenly power, and designed by divine skill. Such a spiritual house ust not be dark, for the Israelites had light in their dwellings; here must therefore be windows to let the light in and to allow the nhabitants to gaze abroad. These windows are precious as agates: the ays in which the church beholds her Lord and heaven, and spiritual ruth in general, are to be had in the highest esteem. Agates are not he most transparent of gems, they are but semi-pellucid at the best:</p>
<p>"Our knowledge of that life is small,</p>
<p>Our eye of faith is dim."</p>
<p>Faith is one of these precious agate windows, but alas! it is often so isty and beclouded, that we see but darkly, and mistake much that we o see. Yet if we cannot gaze through windows of diamonds and know even s we are known, it is a glorious thing to behold the altogether lovely ne, even though the glass be hazy as the agate. Experience is another f these dim but precious windows, yielding to us a subdued religious ight, in which we see the sufferings of the Man of Sorrows, through ur own afflictions. Our weak eyes could not endure windows of ransparent glass to let in the Master's glory, but when they are immed with weeping, the beams of the Sun of Righteousness are empered, and shine through the windows of agate with a soft radiance nexpressibly soothing to tempted souls. Sanctification, as it conforms s to our Lord, is another agate window. Only as we become heavenly can e comprehend heavenly things. The pure in heart see a pure God. Those ho are like Jesus see him as he is. Because we are so little like him, he window is but agate; because we are somewhat like him, it is agate. e thank God for what we have, and long for more. When shall we see God nd Jesus, and heaven and truth, face to face?</p>

<p>They go from strength to strength. There are various renderings of hese words, but all of them contain the idea of progress.</p>
<p>Our own good translation of the authorized version is enough for us his morning. "They go from strength to strength." That is, they grow tronger and stronger. Usually, if we are walking, we go from strength o weakness; we start fresh and in good order for our journey, but y-and-by the road is rough, and the sun is hot, we sit down by the ayside, and then again painfully pursue our weary way. But the hristian pilgrim having obtained fresh supplies of grace, is as igorous after years of toilsome travel and struggle as when he first et out. He may not be quite so elate and buoyant, nor perhaps quite so ot and hasty in his zeal as he once was, but he is much stronger in ll that constitutes real power, and travels, if more slowly, far more urely. Some gray-haired veterans have been as firm in their grasp of ruth, and as zealous in diffusing it, as they were in their younger ays; but, alas, it must be confessed it is often otherwise, for the ove of many waxes cold and iniquity abounds, but this is their own sin nd not the fault of the promise which still holds good: "The youths hall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall, but hey that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall ount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and hey shall walk and not faint." Fretful spirits sit down and trouble hemselves about the future. "Alas!" say they, "we go from affliction o affliction." Very true, O thou of little faith, but then thou goest rom strength to strength also. Thou shalt never find a bundle of ffliction which has not bound up in the midst of it sufficient grace. od will give the strength of ripe manhood with the burden allotted to ull-grown shoulders.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ acted in what he did as a great public epresentative person, and his dying upon the cross was the virtual ying of all his people. Then all his saints rendered unto justice what as due, and made an expiation to divine vengeance for all their sins. he apostle of the Gentiles delighted to think that as one of Christ's hosen people, he died upon the cross in Christ. He did more than elieve this doctrinally, he accepted it confidently, resting his hope pon it. He believed that by virtue of Christ's death, he had satisfied ivine justice, and found reconciliation with God. Beloved, what a lessed thing it is when the soul can, as it were, stretch itself upon he cross of Christ, and feel, "I am dead; the law has slain me, and I m therefore free from its power, because in my Surety I have borne the urse, and in the person of my Substitute the whole that the law could o, by way of condemnation, has been executed upon me, for I am rucified with Christ."</p>
<p>But Paul meant even more than this. He not only believed in Christ's eath, and trusted in it, but he actually felt its power in himself in ausing the crucifixion of his old corrupt nature. When he saw the leasures of sin, he said, "I cannot enjoy these: I am dead to them." Such is the experience of every true Christian. Having received Christ, e is to this world as one who is utterly dead. Yet, while conscious of eath to the world, he can, at the same time, exclaim with the apostle, "Nevertheless I live." He is fully alive unto God. The Christian's life s a matchless riddle. No worldling can comprehend it; even the eliever himself cannot understand it. Dead, yet alive! crucified with hrist, and yet at the same time risen with Christ in newness of life! nion with the suffering, bleeding Saviour, and death to the world and in, are soul-cheering things. O for more enjoyment of them!</p>

<p>Not only that which is seen of the church of God, but that which is nseen, is fair and precious. Foundations are out of sight, and so long s they are firm it is not expected that they should be valuable; but n Jehovah's work everything is of a piece, nothing slurred, nothing ean. The deep foundations of the work of grace are as sapphires for reciousness, no human mind is able to measure their glory. We build pon the covenant of grace, which is firmer than adamant, and as nduring as jewels upon which age spends itself in vain. Sapphire oundations are eternal, and the covenant abides throughout the ifetime of the Almighty. Another foundation is the person of the Lord esus, which is clear and spotless, everlasting and beautiful as the apphire; blending in one the deep blue of earth's ever rolling ocean nd the azure of its all embracing sky. Once might our Lord have been ikened to the ruby as he stood covered with his own blood, but now we ee him radiant with the soft blue of love, love abounding, deep, ternal. Our eternal hopes are built upon the justice and the aithfulness of God, which are clear and cloudless as the sapphire. We re not saved by a compromise, by mercy defeating justice, or law uspending its operations; no, we defy the eagle's eye to detect a flaw n the groundwork of our confidence--our foundation is of sapphire, and ill endure the fire.</p>

<p>The cry of the Christian religion is the gentle word, "Come." The ewish law harshly said, "Go, take heed unto thy steps as to the path n which thou shalt walk. Break the commandments, and thou shalt erish; keep them, and thou shalt live." The law was a dispensation of error, which drove men before it as with a scourge; the gospel draws ith bands of love. Jesus is the good Shepherd going before his sheep, idding them follow him, and ever leading them onwards with the sweet ord, "Come." The law repels, the gospel attracts. The law shows the istance which there is between God and man; the gospel bridges that wful chasm, and brings the sinner across it.</p>
<p>From the first moment of your spiritual life until you are ushered into lory, the language of Christ to you will be, "Come, come unto me." As  mother puts out her finger to her little child and woos it to walk by aying, "Come," even so does Jesus. He will always be ahead of you, idding you follow him as the soldier follows his captain.

<p>Let us note that Christ delights to think upon his Church, and to look pon her beauty. As the bird returneth often to its nest, and as the ayfarer hastens to his home, so doth the mind continually pursue the bject of its choice. We cannot look too often upon that face which we ove; we desire always to have our precious things in our sight. It is ven so with our Lord Jesus. From all eternity "His delights were with he sons of men;" his thoughts rolled onward to the time when his elect hould be born into the world; he viewed them in the mirror of his oreknowledge. "In thy book," he says, "all my members were written, hich in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of hem" (Ps. 139:16). When the world was set upon its pillars, he was here, and he set the bounds of the people according to the number of he children of Israel. Many a time before his incarnation, he escended to this lower earth in the similitude of a man; on the plains f Mamre (Gen. 18), by the brook of Jabbok (Gen. 32:24-30), beneath the alls of Jericho (Jos. 5:13), and in the fiery furnace of Babylon (Dan. :19, 25), the Son of Man visited his people. Because his soul elighted in them, he could not rest away from them, for his heart onged after them. Never were they absent from his heart, for he had ritten their names upon his hands, and graven them upon his side.

<p>Jesus, the great I AM, is the entrance into the true church, and the ay of access to God himself. He gives to the man who comes to God by im four choice privileges.</p>
<p>1. He shall be saved. The fugitive manslayer passed the gate of the ity of refuge, and was safe. Noah entered the door of the ark, and was ecure. None can be lost who take Jesus as the door of faith to their ouls. Entrance through Jesus into peace is the guarantee of entrance y the same door into heaven. Jesus is the only door, an open door, a ide door, a safe door; and blessed is he who rests all his hope of dmission to glory upon the crucified Redeemer.</p>
<p>2. He shall go in. He shall be privileged to go in among the divine amily, sharing the children's bread, and participating in all their onours and enjoyments. He shall go in to the chambers of communion, to he banquets of love, to the treasures of the covenant, to the torehouses of the promises. He shall go in unto the King of kings in he power of the Holy Spirit, and the secret of the Lord shall be with im.</p>
<p>3. He shall go out. This blessing is much forgotten. We go out into the orld to labour and suffer, but what a mercy to go in the name and ower of Jesus! We are called to bear witness to the truth, to cheer he disconsolate, to warn the careless, to win souls, and to glorify od; and as the angel said to Gideon, "Go in this thy might," even thus he Lord would have us proceed as his messengers in his name and trength.</p>
<p>4. He shall find pasture. He who knows Jesus shall never want. Going in nd out shall be alike helpful to him: in fellowship with God he shall row, and in watering others he shall be watered. Having made Jesus his ll, he shall find all in Jesus. His soul shall be as a watered garden, nd as a well of water whose waters fail not.</p>

<p>Rend your heart, and not your garments.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Garment-rending and other outward signs of religious emotion, are asily manifested and are frequently hypocritical; but to feel true epentance is far more difficult, and consequently far less common. Men ill attend to the most multiplied and minute ceremonial egulations--for such things are pleasing to the flesh--but true eligion is too humbling, too heart-searching, too thorough for the astes of the carnal men; they prefer something more ostentatious, limsy, and worldly. Outward observances are temporarily comfortable; ye and ear are pleased; self-conceit is fed, and self-righteousness is uffed up: but they are ultimately delusive, for in the article of eath, and at the day of judgment, the soul needs something more ubstantial than ceremonies and rituals to lean upon. Apart from vital odliness all religion is utterly vain; offered without a sincere eart, every form of worship is a solemn sham and an impudent mockery f the majesty of heaven.</p>
<p>Heart-rending is divinely wrought and solemnly felt. It is a secret rief which is personally experienced, not in mere form, but as a deep, oul-moving work of the Holy Spirit upon the inmost heart of each eliever. It is not a matter to be merely talked of and believed in, ut keenly and sensitively felt in every living child of the living od. It is powerfully humiliating, and completely sin-purging; but then t is sweetly preparative for those gracious consolations which proud nhumbled spirits are unable to receive; and it is distinctly iscriminating, for it belongs to the elect of God, and to them alone.</p>
<p>The text commands us to rend our hearts, but they are naturally hard as arble: how, then, can this be done? We must take them to Calvary: a ying Saviour's voice rent the rocks once, and it is as powerful now. O lessed Spirit, let us hear the death-cries of Jesus, and our hearts hall be rent even as men rend their vestures in the day of amentation.</p>

When a man is anxious he cannot pray with faith; when he is roubled about the world, he cannot serve his Master, his thoughts are erving himself. If you would "seek first the kingdom of God and his ighteousness," all things would then be added unto you. You are eddling with Christ's business, and neglecting your own when you fret bout your lot and circumstances. You have been trying "providing" work nd forgetting that it is yours to obey. Be wise and attend to the beying, and let Christ manage the providing. Come and survey your ather's storehouse, and ask whether he will let you starve while he as laid up so great an abundance in his garner? Look at his heart of ercy; see if that can ever prove unkind! Look at his inscrutable isdom; see if that will ever be at fault. Above all, look up to Jesus hrist your Intercessor, and ask yourself, while he pleads, can your ather deal ungraciously with you? If he remembers even sparrows, will e forget one of the least of his poor children? "Cast thy burden upon he Lord, and he will sustain thee. He will never suffer the righteous o be moved."</p>

A real physical orld without a sea it is mournful to imagine, it would be an iron ring ithout the sapphire which made it precious. There must be a spiritual eaning here. In the new dispensation there will be no division--the ea separates nations and sunders peoples from each other. To John in atmos the deep waters were like prison walls, shutting him out from is brethren and his work: there shall be no such barriers in the world o come.

<p>Sometimes the Lord Jesus tells his Church his love thoughts. "He does ot think it enough behind her back to tell it, but in her very resence he says, Thou art all fair, my love.' It is true, this is not is ordinary method; he is a wise lover, and knows when to keep back he intimation of love and when to let it out; but there are times when e will make no secret of it; times when he will put it beyond all ispute in the souls of his people" (R. Erskine's Sermons). The Holy pirit is often pleased, in a most gracious manner, to witness with our pirits of the love of Jesus. He takes of the things of Christ and eveals them unto us. No voice is heard from the clouds, and no vision s seen in the night, but we have a testimony more sure than either of hese. If an angel should fly from heaven and inform the saint ersonally of the Saviour's love to him, the evidence would not be one hit more satisfactory than that which is borne in the heart by the oly Ghost. Ask those of the Lord's people who have lived the nearest o the gates of heaven, and they will tell you that they have had easons when the love of Christ towards them has been a fact so clear nd sure, that they could no more doubt it than they could question heir own existence. Yes, beloved believer, you and I have had times of efreshing from the presence of the Lord, and then our faith has ounted to the topmost heights of assurance. We have had confidence to ean our heads upon the bosom of our Lord, and we have no more uestioned our Master's affection to us than John did when in that lessed posture; nay, nor so much: for the dark question, "Lord, is it  that shall betray thee?" has been put far from us. He has kissed us ith the kisses of his mouth, and killed our doubts by the closeness of is embrace. His love has been sweeter than wine to our souls.</p>

<p>This covenant is divine in its origin. "He hath made with me an verlasting covenant." Oh that great word He ! Stop, my soul.

Is it ot a deed, the stupendous condescension of which might ravish our earts forever if we could really understand it? "HE hath made with me  covenant." A king has not made a covenant with me--that were omewhat; but the Prince of the kings of the earth, Shaddai, the Lord ll-sufficient, the Jehovah of ages, the everlasting Elohim, "He hath ade with me an everlasting covenant." But notice, it is particular in ts application. "Yet hath he made with me an everlasting covenant." Here lies the sweetness of it to each believer. It is nought for me hat he made peace for the world; I want to know whether he made peace or me! It is little that he hath made a covenant, I want to know hether he has made a covenant with me. Blessed is the assurance that e hath made a covenant with me! If God the Holy Ghost gives me ssurance of this, then his salvation is mine, his heart is mine, he imself is mine--he is my God.</p>
<p>This covenant is everlasting in its duration. An everlasting covenant eans a covenant which had no beginning, and which shall never, never nd.

Now, we are told concerning our Lord, "to as many as eceived him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to s many as believed on his name." Then, if I have received Christ Jesus nto my heart, I am a child of God. That reception is described in the ame verse as believing on the name of Jesus Christ. If, then, I elieve on Jesus Christ's name--that is, simply from my heart trust yself with the crucified, but now exalted, Redeemer, I am a member of he family of the Most High. Whatever else I may not have, if I have his, I have the privilege to become a child of God. Our Lord Jesus uts it in another shape. "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and hey follow me." Here is the matter in a nutshell. Christ appears as a hepherd to his own sheep, not to others. As soon as he appears, his wn sheep perceive him--they trust him, they are prepared to follow im; he knows them, and they know him--there is a mutual nowledge--there is a constant connection between them. Thus the one ark, the sure mark, the infallible mark of regeneration and adoption s a hearty faith in the appointed Redeemer.

<p>When first the life of grace begins in the soul, we do indeed draw near o God, but it is with great fear and trembling.

With unfeigned bashfulness it akes the lowest room.</p>
<p>But, in after life, as the Christian grows in grace, although he will ever forget the solemnity of his position, and will never lose that oly awe which must encompass a gracious man when he is in the presence f the God who can create or can destroy; yet his fear has all its error taken out of it; it becomes a holy reverence, and no more an vershadowing dread. He is called up higher, to greater access to God n Christ Jesus. Then the man of God, walking amid the splendours of eity, and veiling his face like the glorious cherubim, with those twin ings, the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ, will, reverent and owed in spirit, approach the throne; and seeing there a God of love, f goodness, and of mercy, he will realize rather the covenant haracter of God than his absolute Deity. He will see in God rather his oodness than his greatness, and more of his love than of his majesty. hen will the soul, bowing still as humbly as aforetime, enjoy a more acred liberty of intercession; for while prostrate before the glory of he Infinite God, it will be sustained by the refreshing consciousness f being in the presence of boundless mercy and infinite love, and by he realization of acceptance "in the Beloved." Thus the believer is idden to come up higher, and is enabled to exercise the privilege of ejoicing in God, and drawing near to him in holy confidence, saying, "Abba, Father."</p>

Had he remained upon his throne of glory, and had we continued n the ruins of the fall without receiving his salvation, communion ould have been impossible on both sides. Our position by the fall, part from the covenant of grace, made it as impossible for fallen man o communicate with God as it is for Belial to be in concord with hrist. In order, therefore, that communion might be compassed, it was ecessary that the rich kinsman should bestow his estate upon his poor elatives, that the righteous Saviour should give to his sinning rethren of his own perfection, and that we, the poor and guilty, hould receive of his fulness grace for grace; that thus in giving and eceiving, the One might descend from the heights, and the other ascend rom the depths, and so be able to embrace each other in true and earty fellowship. Poverty must be enriched by him in whom are infinite reasures before it can venture to commune; and guilt must lose itself n imputed and imparted righteousness ere the soul can walk in ellowship with purity. Jesus must clothe his people in his own arments, or he cannot admit them into his palace of glory; and he must ash them in his own blood, or else they will be too defiled for the mbrace of his fellowship.</p>
<p>O believer, herein is love! For your sake the Lord Jesus "became poor" that he might lift you up into communion with himself.</p>

Since enturous woman led the way in the sin which brought forth Paradise ost, she, and she alone, ushers in the Regainer of Paradise.

<p>What the patriarch did early in the morning, after the family estivities, it will be well for the believer to do for himself ere he ests tonight. Amid the cheerfulness of household gatherings it is easy o slide into sinful levities, and to forget our avowed character as hristians. It ought not to be so, but so it is, that our days of easting are very seldom days of sanctified enjoyment, but too requently degenerate into unhallowed mirth. There is a way of joy as ure and sanctifying as though one bathed in the rivers of Eden: holy ratitude should be quite as purifying an element as grief. Alas! for ur poor hearts, that facts prove that the house of mourning is better han the house of feasting. Come, believer, in what have you sinned oday? Have you been forgetful of your high calling? Have you been even s others in idle words and loose speeches? Then confess the sin, and ly to the sacrifice. The sacrifice sanctifies. The precious blood of he Lamb slain removes the guilt, and purges away the defilement of our ins of ignorance and carelessness. This is the best ending of a hristmas-day--to wash anew in the cleansing fountain. Believer, come o this sacrifice continually; if it be so good tonight, it is good very night. To live at the altar is the privilege of the royal riesthood; to them sin, great as it is, is nevertheless no cause for espair, since they draw near yet again to the sin-atoning victim, and heir conscience is purged from dead works.</p>
<p>Gladly I close this festive day,</p>

<p>Jesus is the federal head of his elect. As in Adam, every heir of flesh nd blood has a personal interest, because he is the covenant head and epresentative of the race as considered under the law of works; so nder the law of grace, every redeemed soul is one with the Lord from eaven, since he is the Second Adam, the Sponsor and Substitute of the lect in the new covenant of love. The apostle Paul declares that Levi as in the loins of Abraham when Melchizedek met him: it is a certain ruth that the believer was in the loins of Jesus Christ, the Mediator, hen in old eternity the covenant settlements of grace were decreed, atified, and made sure forever. Thus, whatever Christ hath done, he ath wrought for the whole body of his Church. We were crucified in him nd buried with him (read Col. 2:10-13), and to make it still more onderful, we are risen with him and even ascended with him to the eats on high (Eph. 2:6). It is thus that the Church has fulfilled the aw, and is "accepted in the beloved." It is thus that she is regarded ith complacency by the just Jehovah, for he views her in Jesus, and oes not look upon her as separate from her covenant head. As the nointed Redeemer of Israel, Christ Jesus has nothing distinct from his hurch, but all that he has he holds for her. Adam's righteousness was urs so long as he maintained it, and his sin was ours the moment that e committed it; and in the same manner, all that the Second Adam is or oes, is ours as well as his, seeing that he is our representative. ere is the foundation of the covenant of grace. This gracious system f representation and substitution, which moved Justin Martyr to cry ut, "O blessed change, O sweet permutation!" this is the very roundwork of the gospel of our salvation, and is to be received with trong faith and rapturous joy.</p>

And a blessed truth it is, or where Jesus is, love becomes inflamed. Of all the things in the orld that can set the heart burning, there is nothing like the resence of Jesus! A glimpse of him so overcomes us, that we are ready o say, "Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me." Even he smell of the aloes, and the myrrh, and the cassia, which drop from is perfumed garments, causes the sick and the faint to grow strong. et there be but a moment's leaning of the head upon that gracious osom, and a reception of his divine love into our poor cold hearts, nd we are cold no longer, but glow like seraphs, equal to every abour, and capable of every suffering.

<p>The rush is spongy and hollow, and even so is a hypocrite; there is no ubstance or stability in him. It is shaken to and fro in every wind ust as formalists yield to every influence; for this reason the rush s not broken by the tempest, neither are hypocrites troubled with ersecution. I would not willingly be a deceiver or be deceived; erhaps the text for this day may help me to try myself whether I be a ypocrite or no. The rush by nature lives in water, and owes its very xistence to the mire and moisture wherein it has taken root; let the ire become dry, and the rush withers very quickly. Its greenness is bsolutely dependent upon circumstances, a present abundance of water akes it flourish, and a drought destroys it at once. Is this my case? o I only serve God when I am in good company, or when religion is rofitable and respectable? Do I love the Lord only when temporal omforts are received from his hands? If so I am a base hypocrite, and ike the withering rush, I shall perish when death deprives me of utward joys. But can I honestly assert that when bodily comforts have een few, and my surroundings have been rather adverse to grace than at ll helpful to it, I have still held fast my integrity? Then have I ope that there is genuine vital godliness in me. The rush cannot grow ithout mire, but plants of the Lord's right hand planting can and do lourish even in the year of drought. A godly man often grows best when is worldly circumstances decay. He who follows Christ for his bag is a udas; they who follow for loaves and fishes are children of the devil; ut they who attend him out of love to himself are his own beloved nes.

We are not merely to be guided sometimes, but we re to have a perpetual monitor; not occasionally to be left to our own nderstanding, and so to wander, but we are continually to hear the uiding voice of the Great Shepherd; and if we follow close at his eels, we shall not err, but be led by a right way to a city to dwell n.

<p>Patience had her perfect work in the Lord Jesus, and until the last day f the feast he pleaded with the Jews, even as on this last day of the ear he pleads with us, and waits to be gracious to us. Admirable ndeed is the longsuffering of the Saviour in bearing with some of us ear after year, notwithstanding our provocations, rebellions, and esistance of his Holy Spirit. Wonder of wonders that we are still in he land of mercy!</p>
<p>Pity expressed herself most plainly, for Jesus cried, which implies not nly the loudness of his voice, but the tenderness of his tones. He ntreats us to be reconciled. "We pray you," says the Apostle, "as hough God did beseech you by us." What earnest, pathetic terms are hese! How deep must be the love which makes the Lord weep over inners, and like a mother woo his children to his bosom! Surely at the all of such a cry our willing hearts will come.</p>
<p>Provision is made most plenteously; all is provided that man can need o quench his soul's thirst. To his conscience the atonement brings eace; to his understanding the gospel brings the richest instruction; o his heart the person of Jesus is the noblest object of affection; to he whole man the truth as it is in Jesus supplies the purest utriment. Thirst is terrible, but Jesus can remove it. Though the soul ere utterly famished, Jesus could restore it.</p>
<p>Proclamation is made most freely, that every thirsty one is welcome. No ther distinction is made but that of thirst. Whether it be the thirst f avarice, ambition, pleasure, knowledge, or rest, he who suffers from t is invited. The thirst may be bad in itself, and be no sign of race, but rather a mark of inordinate sin longing to be gratified with eeper draughts of lust; but it is not goodness in the creature which rings him the invitation, the Lord Jesus sends it freely, and without espect of persons.</p>
<p>Personality is declared most fully. The sinner must come to Jesus, not o works, ordinances, or doctrines, but to a personal Redeemer, who his wn self bare our sins in his own body on the tree. The bleeding, ying, rising Saviour, is the only star of hope to a sinner. Oh for race to come now and drink, ere the sun sets upon the year's last day!</p>
<p>No waiting or preparation is so much as hinted at. Drinking represents  reception for which no fitness is required. A fool, a thief, a harlot an drink; and so sinfulness of character is no bar to the invitation o believe in Jesus. We want no golden cup, no bejewelled chalice, in hich to convey the water to the thirsty; the mouth of poverty is elcome to stoop down and quaff the flowing flood. Blistered, leprous, ilthy lips may touch the stream of divine love; they cannot pollute t, but shall themselves be purified. Jesus is the fount of hope. Dear eader, hear the dear Redeemer's loving voice as he cries to each of s,</p>
<p>"IF ANY MAN THIRST,</p>
<p>LET HIM</p>
<p>COME UNTO ME</p>
<p>AND DRINK."</p>

<p>Not saved! Dear reader, is this your mournful plight? Warned of the udgment to come, bidden to escape for your life, and yet at this oment not saved! You know the way of salvation, you read it in the ible, you hear it from the pulpit, it is explained to you by friends, nd yet you neglect it, and therefore you are not saved. You will be ithout excuse when the Lord shall judge the quick and dead. The Holy pirit has given more or less of blessing upon the word which has been reached in your hearing, and times of refreshing have come from the ivine presence, and yet you are without Christ. All these hopeful easons have come and gone--your summer and your harvest have past--and et you are not saved. Years have followed one another into eternity, nd your last year will soon be here: youth has gone, manhood is going, nd yet you are not saved. Let me ask you--will you ever be saved? Is here any likelihood of it? Already the most propitious seasons have eft you unsaved; will other occasions alter your condition? Means have ailed with you--the best of means, used perseveringly and with the tmost affection--what more can be done for you? Affliction and rosperity have alike failed to impress you; tears and prayers and ermons have been wasted on your barren heart. Are not the robabilities dead against your ever being saved? Is it not more than ikely that you will abide as you are till death forever bars the door f hope? Do you recoil from the supposition? Yet it is a most easonable one: he who is not washed in so many waters will in all robability go filthy to his end. The convenient time never has come, hy should it ever come? It is logical to fear that it never will rrive, and that Felix like, you will find no convenient season till ou are in hell. O bethink you of what that hell is, and of the dread robability that you will soon be cast into it!</p>
<p>Reader, suppose you should die unsaved, your doom no words can picture. rite out your dread estate in tears and blood, talk of it with groans nd gnashing of teeth: you will be punished with everlasting estruction from the glory of the Lord, and from the glory of his ower. A brother's voice would fain startle you into earnestness. O be ise, be wise in time, and ere another year begins, believe in Jesus, ho is able to save to the uttermost. Consecrate these last hours to onely thought, and if deep repentance be bred in you, it will be well; nd if it lead to a humble faith in Jesus, it will be best of all. O ee to it that this year pass not away, and you an unforgiven spirit. et not the new year's midnight peals sound upon a joyless spirit! Now, ow, NOW believe, and live.</p>
<p>"ESCAPE FOR THY LIFE;</p>
<p>LOOK NOT BEHIND THEE,</p>
<p>NEITHER STAY THOU IN ALL THE PLAIN;</p>
<p>ESCAPE TO THE MOUNTAIN,</p>
<p>LEST THOU BE CONSUMED."</p>
